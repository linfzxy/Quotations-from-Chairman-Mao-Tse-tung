			为了正确地认识敌我之间和人民内部这两类不同的矛盾，应该首先弄清楚什么是人民，什么是敌人。……在现阶段，在建设社会主义的时期，一切赞成、拥护和参加社会主义建设事业的阶级、阶层和社会集团，都属于人民的范围；一切反抗社会主义革命和敌视、破坏社会主义建设的社会势力和社会集团，都是人民的敌人。<br/>&#13;
			――《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》（一九五七年二月二十七日），人民出版社版第一――二页<br/>&#13;
			To understand these two different types of contradictions correctly, &#13;
			we must first be clear on what is meant by "the people" and what is &#13;
			meant by "the enemy" ... At the present stage, the period of &#13;
			building socialism, the classes, strata and social groups which &#13;
			favour, support and work for the cause of socialist construction all &#13;
			come within the category of the people, while the social forces and &#13;
			groups which resist the socialist revolution and are hostile to or &#13;
			sabotage socialist construction are all enemies of the people.<br/>&#13;

			在我国现在的条件下，所谓人民内部的矛盾，包括工人阶级内部的矛盾，农民阶级内部的矛盾，知识分子内部的矛盾，工农两个阶级之间的矛盾，工人、农民同知识分子之间的矛盾，工人阶级和其他劳动人民同民族资产阶级之间的矛盾，民族资产阶级内部的矛盾，等等。我们的人民政府是真正代表人民利益的政府，是为人民服务的政府，但是它同人民群众之间也有一定的矛盾。这种矛盾包括国家利益、集体利益同个人利益之间的矛盾，民主同集中的矛盾，领导同被领导之间的矛盾，国家机关某些工作人员的官僚主义作风同群众之间的矛盾。这种矛盾也是人民内部的一个矛盾。一般说来，人民内部的矛盾，是在人民利益根本一致的基础上的矛盾。<br/>&#13;

			In the conditions prevailing in China today, the contradictions &#13;
			among the people comprise the contradictions within the working &#13;
			class, the contradictions within the peasantry, the contradictions &#13;
			within the intelligentsia, the contradictions between the working &#13;
			class and the peasantry, the contradictions between the workers and &#13;
			peasants on the one hand and the intellectuals on the other, the &#13;
			contradictions between the working class and other sections of the &#13;
			working people on the one hand and the national bourgeoisie on the &#13;
			other, the contradictions within the national bourgeoisie, and so &#13;
			on. Our People's Government is one that genuinely represents the &#13;
			people's interests, it is a government that serves the people. &#13;
			Nevertheless, there are still certain contradictions between the &#13;
			government and the people. These include contradictions among the &#13;
			interests of the state, the interests of the collective and the &#13;
			interests of the individual; between democracy and centralism; &#13;
			between the leadership and the led; and the contradiction arising &#13;
			from the bureaucratic style of work of certain government workers in &#13;
			their relations with the masses. All these are also contradictions &#13;
			among the people. Generally speaking, the people's basic identity of &#13;
			interests underlies the contradictions among the people.<br/>&#13;
			D Ibid., pp. 3-4.<br/>&#13;
			<br/>&#13;
			敌我之间的矛盾是对抗性的矛盾。人民内部的矛盾，在劳动人民之间说来，是非对抗性的；在被剥削阶级和剥削阶级之间说来，除了对抗性的一面以外，还有非对抗性的一面。<br/>&#13;
			――《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》（一九五七年二月二十七日），人民出版社版第二页<br/>&#13;
			The contradictions between ourselves and the enemy are antagonistic &#13;
			contradictions. Within the ranks of the people, the contradictions &#13;
			among the working people are non-antagonistic, while those between &#13;
			the exploited and the exploiting classes have a non-antagonistic &#13;
			aspect in addition to an antagonistic aspect.<br/>&#13;

			在我国人民的政治生活中，应当怎样来判断我们的言论和行动的是非呢？我们以为，根据我国的宪法的原则，根据我国最大多数人民的意志和我国各党派历次宣布的共同的政治主张，这种标准可以大致规定如下：（一）有利于团结全国各族人民，而不是分裂人民；（二）有利于社会主义改造和社会主义建设，而不是不利于社会主义改造和社会主义建设；（三）有利于巩固人民民主专政，而不是破坏或者削弱这个专政；（四）有利于巩固民主集中制，而不是破坏或者削弱这个制度；（五）有利于巩固共产党的领导，而不是摆脱或者削弱这种领导；（六）有利于社会主义的国际团结和全世界爱好和平人民的国际团结，而不是有损于这些团结。这六条标准中，最重要的是社会主义道路和党的领导两条。<br/>&#13;

			In the political life of our people, how should right be &#13;
			distinguished from wrong in one's words and actions? On the basis of &#13;
			the principles of our Constitution, the will of the overwhelming &#13;
			majority of our people and the common political positions which have &#13;
			been proclaimed on various occasions by our political parties and &#13;
			groups, we consider that, broadly speaking, the criteria should be &#13;
			as follows:<br/>&#13;
			(1) Words and actions should help to unite, and not divide, the &#13;
			people of our various nationalities.<br/>&#13;
			(2) They should be beneficial, and not harmful, to socialist &#13;
			transformation and socialist construction.<br/>&#13;
			(3) They should help to consolidate, and not undermine or weaken, &#13;
			the people's democratic dictatorship.<br/>&#13;
			(4) They should help to consolidate, and not undermine or weaken, &#13;
			democratic centralism.<br/>&#13;
			(5) They should help to strengthen, and not discard or weaken, the &#13;
			leadership of the Communist Party.<br/>&#13;
			(6) They should be beneficial, and not harmful, to international &#13;
			socialist unity and the unity of the peace-loving people of the &#13;
			world.<br/>&#13;
			Of these six criteria, the most important are the socialist path and &#13;

			肃清反革命分子的问题是敌我矛盾的斗争问题。在人民内部，有些人对于肃反问题的看法，也有一些不同。有两种人的意见，和我们的意见不相同。有右倾思想的人不分敌我，认敌为我。广大群众认为是敌人的人，他们却认为是朋友。有“左”倾思想的人则把敌我矛盾扩大化，以至把某些人民内部的矛盾也看做敌我矛盾，把某些本来不是反革命的人也看作反革命。这两种看法都是错误的，都不能正确地处理肃反问题，也不能正确地估计我们的肃反工作。<br/>&#13;
			――《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》（一九五七年二月二十七日），人民出版社版第一三页<br/>&#13;
			The question of suppressing counterrevolutionaries is one of a &#13;
			struggle between ourselves and the enemy, a contradiction between &#13;
			ourselves and the enemy. Among the people, there are some who see &#13;
			this question in a somewhat different light. Two kinds of persons &#13;
			hold views different from ours. Those with a Rightist way of &#13;
			thinking make no distinction between ourselves and the enemy and &#13;
			take the enemy for our own people. They regard as friends the very &#13;
			persons whom the broad masses regard as enemies. Those with a "Left" &#13;
			way of thinking magnify contradictions between ourselves and the &#13;
			enemy to such an extent that they take certain contradictions among &#13;
			the people for contradictions with the enemy and regard as counter-revolutionary &#13;
			persons who are actually not counter-revolutionaries. Both these &#13;
			views are wrong. Neither can lead to the correct handling of the &#13;
			question of suppressing counter-revolutionaries or to a correct &#13;
			assessment of this work.<br/>&#13;

			不同质的矛盾，只有用不同持的方法才能解决。例如，无产阶级和资产阶级的矛盾，用社会主义革命的方法去解决；人民大众和封建制度的矛盾，用民主革命的方法去解决；殖民地和帝国主义的矛盾，用民族革命战争的方法去解决；在社会主义社会中工人阶级和农民阶级的矛盾，用农业集体化和农业机械化的方法去解决；共产党内部的矛盾，用批评和自我批评的方法去解决；社会和自然的矛盾，用发展生产力的方法去解决。……用不同的方法去解决不同的矛盾，这是马克思列宁主义者必须严格地遵守的一个原则<br/>&#13;
			――《矛盾论》（一九三七年八月），《毛泽东选集》第一卷第二九九页<br/>&#13;
			Qualitatively different contradictions can only be resolved by &#13;
			qualitatively different methods. For instance, the contradiction &#13;
			between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is resolved by the &#13;
			method of socialist revolution; the contradiction between the great &#13;
			masses of the people and the feudal system is resolved by the method &#13;
			of democratic revolution; the contradiction between the colonies and &#13;
			imperialism is resolved by the method of national revolutionary war; &#13;
			the contradiction between the working class and the peasant class in &#13;
			socialist society is resolved by the method of collectivization and &#13;
			mechanization in agriculture; contradiction within the Communist &#13;
			Party is resolved by the method of criticism and self-criticism; the &#13;
			contradiction between society and nature is resolved by the method &#13;
			of developing the productive forces.... The principle of using &#13;
			different methods to resolve different contradictions is one which &#13;
			Marxist-Leninists must strictly observe.<br/>&#13;

			敌我之间和人民内部这两类矛盾的性质不同，解决的方法也不同，简单地说起来，前者是分清敌我的问题，后者是分清是非的问题。当然，敌我问题也是一种是非问题。比如我们同帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义这些内外反动派，究竟谁是谁非，也是是非问题，但是这是和人民内部问题性质不同的另一类是非问题。<br/>&#13;

			Since they are different in nature, the contradictions between &#13;
			ourselves and the enemy and the contradictions among the people must &#13;
			be resolved by different methods. To put it briefly, the former are &#13;
			a matter of drawing a clear distinction between ourselves and the &#13;
			enemy, and the latter a matter of drawing a clear distinction &#13;
			between right and wrong. It is, of course, true that the distinction &#13;
			between ourselves and the enemy is also a matter of right and wrong. &#13;
			For example, the question of who is in the right, we or the domestic &#13;
			and foreign reactionaries, the imperialists, the feudalists and &#13;
			bureaucrat-capitalists, is also a matter of right and wrong, but it &#13;
			is in a different category from questions of right and wrong among &#13;
			the people.<br/>&#13;

			凡属于思想性质的问题，凡属于人民内部的争论问题，只能用民主的方法去解决，只能用讨论的方法、批评的方法、说服教育的方法去解决，而不能用强制的、压服的方法去解决。<br/>&#13;

			人民为了有效地进行生产、进行学习和有秩序地过生活，要求自己的政府、生产的领导者、文化教育机关的领导者发布各种适当的带强制性的行政命令。没有这种行政命令，社会秩序就无法维持，这是人们的常识所了解的。这同用说服教育的方法去解决人民内部的矛盾，是相辅相成的两个方面。为着维持社会秩序的目的而发布的行政命令，也要伴之以说服教育，单靠行政命令，在许多情况下就行不通。<br/>&#13;
			――《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》（一九五七年二月二十七日），人民出版社版第六页<br/>&#13;
			To be able to carry on their production and studies effectively and &#13;
			to arrange their lives properly, the people want their government &#13;
			and those in charge of production and of cultural and educational &#13;
			organizations to issue appropriate orders of an obligatory nature. &#13;
			It is common sense that the maintenance of public order would be &#13;
			impossible without such administrative regulations. Administrative &#13;
			orders and the method of persuasion and education complement each &#13;
			other in resolving contradictions among the people. Even &#13;
			administrative regulations for the maintenance of public order must &#13;
			be accompanied by persuasion and education, for in many cases &#13;
			regulations alone will not work.<br/>&#13;

			资产阶级、小资产阶级，他们的思想意识是一定要反映出来的。一定要在政治问题和思想问题上，用各种办法顽强地表现他们自己。要他们不反映不表现，是不可能的。我们不应当用压制的办法不让他们表现，而应当让他们表现，同时在他们表现的时候，和他们辩论，进行适当的批评。毫无疑问，我们应当批评各种各样的错误思想。不加批评，看着错误思想到处泛滥，任凭它们去占领市场，当然不行。有错误就得批判，有毒草就得进行斗争。但是这种批评不应当是教条主义的，不应当用形而上学方法，应当力求用辩证方法。要有科学的分析，要有充分的说服力。<br/>&#13;

			矛盾和斗争是普遍的、绝对的，但是解决矛盾的方法，即斗争的形式，则因矛盾的性质不同而不相同。有些矛盾具有公开的对抗性，有些矛盾则不是这样。根据事物的具体发展，有些矛盾是由原来还非对抗性的，而发展成为对抗性的；也有些矛盾则由原来是对抗性的，而发展成为非对抗性的。<br/>&#13;

			在一般情况下，人民内部的矛盾不是对抗性的。但是如果处理得不适当，或者失去警觉，麻痹大意，也可能发生对抗。这种情况，在社会主义国家通常只是局部的暂时的现象。这是因为社会主义国家消灭了人剥削人的制度，人民的利益在根本上是一致的。<br/>&#13;

			在我们国家里，工人阶级同民族资产阶级的矛盾属于人民内部的矛盾。工人阶级和民族资产阶级的阶级斗争一般地属于人民内部的阶级斗争，这是因为我国的民族资产阶级有两面性。在资产阶级民主革命时期，它有革命性的一面，又有妥协性的一面。在社会主义革命时期，它有剥削工人阶级取得利润的一面，又有拥护宪法、愿意接受社会主义改造的一面。民族资产阶级和帝国主义、地主阶级、官僚资产阶级不同。工人阶级和民族资产阶级之间存在着剥削和被剥削的矛盾，这本来是对抗性的矛盾。但是在我国的具体条件下，这两个阶级的对抗性的矛盾如果处理得当，可以转变为非对抗性的矛盾，可以用和平的方法解决这个矛盾。如果我们处理不当，不是对民族资产阶级采取团结、批评、教育的政策，或者民族资产阶级不接受我们的这个政策，那末工人阶级同民族资产阶级之间的矛盾就会变成敌我之间的矛盾。<br/>&#13;

			In our country, the contradiction between the working class and the &#13;
			national bourgeoisie belongs to the category of contradictions among &#13;
			the people. By and large, the class struggle between the two is a &#13;
			class struggle within the ranks of the people, because the Chinese &#13;
			national bourgeoisie has a dual character. In the period of the &#13;
			bourgeois-democratic revolution, it had both a revolutionary and a &#13;
			conciliationist side to its character. In the period of the &#13;
			socialist revolution, exploitation of the working class for profit &#13;
			constitutes one side of the character of the national bourgeoisie, &#13;
			while its support of the Constitution and its willingness to accept &#13;
			socialist transformation constitute the other. The national &#13;
			bourgeoisie differs from the imperialists, the landlords and the &#13;
			bureaucrat-capitalists. The contradiction between the national &#13;
			bourgeoisie and the working class is one between the exploiter and &#13;
			the exploited, and is by nature antagonistic. But in the concrete &#13;
			conditions of China, this antagonistic class contradiction can, if &#13;
			properly handled, be transformed into a non-antagonistic one and be &#13;
			resolved by peaceful methods. However, it will change into a &#13;
			contradiction between ourselves and the enemy if we do not handle it &#13;
			properly and do not follow the policy of uniting with, criticizing &#13;
			and educating the national bourgeoisie, or if the national &#13;
			bourgeoisie does not accept this policy of ours.<br/>&#13;
