			军队应实行一定限度的民主化，主要地是废除封建主义的打骂制度和官兵生活同甘苦。这样一来，官兵一致的目的就达到了，军队就增加了绝大的战斗力，长期的残酷的战争就不患不能支持。<br/>&#13;
			――《论持久战》（一九三八年五月），《毛泽东选集》第二卷第五零零――五零一页<br/>&#13;
			A proper measure of democracy should be put into effect in the army, &#13;
			chiefly by abolishing the feudal practice of bullying and beating &#13;
			and by having officers and men share weal and woe. Once this is &#13;
			done, unity will be achieved between officers and men, the combat &#13;
			effectiveness of the army will be greatly increased, and there will &#13;
			be no doubt of our ability to sustain the long, cruel war.<br/>&#13;

			红军的物质生活如此菲薄，战斗如此频繁，仍能维持不敝，除党的作用外，就是靠实行军队内的民主主义。官长不打士兵，官兵待遇平等，士兵有开会说话的自由，废除烦琐的礼节，经济公开。……中国不但人民需要民主主义，军队也需要民主主义。军队内的民主主义制度，将是破坏封建雇佣军队的一个重要的武器。<br/>&#13;
			――《井冈山的斗争》（一九二八年十一月二十五日），《毛泽东选集》第一卷第六七――六八页<br/>&#13;
			Apart from the role played by the Party, the reason why the Red Army &#13;
			has been able to carry on in spite of such poor material conditions &#13;
			and such frequent engagements is its practice of democracy. The &#13;
			officers do not beat the men; officers and men receive equal &#13;
			treatment; soldiers are free to hold meetings and to speak out; &#13;
			trivial formalities have been done away with; and the accounts are &#13;
			open for all to inspect.... In China the army needs democracy as &#13;
			much as the people do. Democracy in our army is an important weapon &#13;
			for undermining the feudal mercenary army.<br/>&#13;

			部队内部政治工作方针，是放手发动士兵群众、指挥员和一切工作人员，通过集中领导下的民主运动，达到政治上高度团结、生活上获得改善、军事上提高技术和战术的三大目的。目前在我军部队中热烈进行的三查、三整，就是用政治民主、经济民主的方法，达到前两项目的。<br/>&#13;
			关于经济民主，必须使士兵选出的代表有权协助（不是超过）连队首长管理连队的给养和伙食。<br/>&#13;
			关于军事民主，必须在练兵时实行官兵互教，兵兵互教；在作战时，实行在火线上连队开各种大、小会。在连队首长指导下，发动士兵群众讨论如何攻克敌阵，如何完成战斗任务。在连续几天的战斗中，此种会应开几次。此项军事民主，在陕北蟠龙战役和晋察冀石家庄战役中，都实行了，收到了极大效果。证明只有好处，毫无害处。<br/>&#13;

			The policy for political work in our army units is fully to arouse &#13;
			the rank and file, the commanders and all working personnel in order &#13;
			to achieve three major objectives through a democratic movement &#13;
			under centralized leadership, namely, a high degree of political &#13;
			unity, better living conditions, and better military technique and &#13;
			tactics. The Three Check-ups and Three Improvements [1] now being &#13;
			enthusiastically carried out in our army units are intended to &#13;
			attain the first two of these objectives through the methods of &#13;
			political and economic democracy.<br/>&#13;
			With regard to economic democracy, the representatives elected by &#13;
			the soldiers must be ensured the right to assist (but not to bypass) &#13;
			the company leadership in managing the company's supplies and mess.<br/>&#13;
			With regard to military democracy, in periods of training there must &#13;
			be mutual instruction as between officers and soldiers and among the &#13;
			soldiers themselves; and in periods of fighting the companies at the &#13;
			front must hold big and small meetings of various kinds. Under the &#13;
			direction of the company leadership, the rank and file should be &#13;
			roused to discuss how to attack and capture enemy positions and how &#13;
			to fulfill other combat tasks. When the fighting lasts several days, &#13;
			several such meetings should be held. This kind of military &#13;
			democracy was practised with great success in the battle of Panlung &#13;
			in northern Shensi and in the battle of Shihchiachuang in the &#13;
			Shansi-Chahar-Hopei area. It has been proved that the practice can &#13;
			only do good and can do no harm whatsoever.<br/>&#13;

			处在伟大斗争面前的中国共产党，要求整个党的领导机关，全党的党员和干部，高度地发挥其积极性，才能取得胜利。所谓发挥积极性，必须具体地表现在领导机关、干部和党员的创造能力，负责精神，工作的活跃，敢于和善于提出问题、发表意见、批评缺点，以及对于领导机关和领导干部从爱护观点出发的监督作用。没有这些，所谓积极性就是空的。而这些积极性的发挥，有赖于党内生活的民主化。党内缺乏民主生活，发挥积极性的目的就不能达到。大批能干人材的创造，也只有在民主生活中才有可能。<br/>&#13;
			――《中国共产党在民族战争中的地位》（一九三八年十月），《毛泽东选集》第二卷第五一七页<br/>&#13;
			In the present great struggle, the Chinese Communist Party demands &#13;
			that all its leading bodies and all its members and cadres should &#13;
			give the fullest expression to their initiative, which alone can &#13;
			ensure victory. This initiative must be demonstrated concretely in &#13;
			the ability of the leading bodies, the cadres and the Party rank and &#13;
			file to work creatively, in their readiness to assume &#13;
			responsibility, in the exuberant vigour they show in their work, in &#13;
			their courage and ability to raise questions, voice opinions and &#13;
			criticize defects, and in the comradely supervision that is &#13;
			maintained over the leading bodies and the leading cadres. &#13;
			Otherwise, "initiative" will be an empty thing. But the exercise of &#13;
			such initiative depends on the spread of democracy in Party life. It &#13;
			cannot be brought into play if there is not enough democracy in &#13;
			Party life. Only in an atmosphere of democracy can large numbers of &#13;
			able people be brought forward.<br/>&#13;

			不论什么人，只要不是敌对分子，不是恶意攻击，允许大家讲话，讲错了也不要紧。各级领导人员，有责任听别人的话。实行两条原则：（一）知无不言，言无不尽；（二）言者无罪，闻者足戒。如果没有“言者无罪”一条，并且是真的，不是假的，就不可能收到“知无不言，言无不尽”的效果。<br/>&#13;
			――《一九四五年的任务》（一九四四年十二月十五日），一九四四年十二月十六日延安《解放日报》<br/>&#13;
			Anyone should be allowed to speak out, whoever he may be, so long as &#13;
			he is not a hostile element and does not make malicious attacks, and &#13;
			it does not matter if he says something wrong. Leaders at all levels &#13;
			have the duty to listen to others. Two principles must be observed: &#13;
			(1) Say all you know and say it without reserve; (2) Don't blame the &#13;
			speaker but take his words as a warning. Unless the principle of &#13;
			"Don't blame the speaker" is observed genuinely and not falsely, the &#13;
			result will not be "Say all you know and say it without reserve".<br/>&#13;

			必须在党内施行有关民主生活的教育，使党员懂得什么是民主生活，什么是民主制和集中制的关系，并如何实行民主集中制。这样才能做到：一方面，确实扩大党内的民主生活；又一方面，不至于走到极端民主化，走到破坏纪律的自由放任主义。<br/>&#13;
			――《中国共产党在民族战争中的地位》（一九三八年十月），《毛泽东选集》第二卷第五一七页<br/>&#13;
			Education in democracy must be carried on within the Party so that &#13;
			members can understand the meaning of democratic life, the meaning &#13;
			of the relationship between democracy and centralism, and the way in &#13;
			which democratic centralism should be put into practice. Only in &#13;
			this way can we really extend democracy within the Party and at the &#13;
			same time avoid ultra-democracy and the laissez-faire which destroys &#13;
			discipline.<br/>&#13;

			无论在军队或在地方，党内民主都应是为着巩固纪律和增强战斗力，而不是削弱这种纪律和战斗力。<br/>&#13;
			――《中国共产党在民族战争中的地位》（一九三八年十月），《毛泽东选集》第二卷第五一七――五一八页<br/>&#13;
			Both in the army and in the local organizations, inner-Party &#13;

			从理论上铲除极端民主化的根苗。首先，要指出极端民主化的危险，在于损伤以至完全破坏党的组织，削弱以至完全毁灭党的战斗力，使党担负不起斗争的责任，由此造成革命的失败。其次，要指出极端民主化的来源，在于小资产阶级的自由散漫性。这种自由散漫性带到党内，就成了政治上的和组织上的极端民主化的思想。这种思想是和无产阶级的斗争任务根本不相容的。<br/>&#13;
			――《关于纠正党内的错误思想》（一九二九年十二月），《毛泽东选集》第一卷第九一页<br/>&#13;
			In the sphere of theory, destroy the roots of ultra-democracy. &#13;
			First, it should be pointed out that the danger of ultrademocracy &#13;
			lies in the fact that it damages or even completely wrecks the &#13;
			Party organization and weakens or even completely undermines the &#13;
			Party's fighting capacity, rendering the Party incapable of &#13;
			fulfilling its fighting tasks and thereby causing the defeat of the &#13;
			revolution. Next, it should be pointed out that the source of &#13;
			ultra-democracy consists in the petty bourgeoisie's individualistic &#13;
			aversion to discipline. When this characteristic is brought into the &#13;
			Party, it develops into ultra-democratic ideas politically and &#13;
			organizationally. These ideas are utterly incompatible with the &#13;
			fighting tasks of the proletariat.<br/>&#13;

			education in the army which was carried out by our Party in &#13;
			conjunction with the land reform during the People's War of &#13;
			Liberation. In the localities, the "Three Check-ups" meant checking &#13;
			on class origin, ideology and style of work; in the armed units, the &#13;
			check-ups were on class origin, performance of duty and will to &#13;
			fight. The "Three Improvements" meant organizational consolidation, &#13;
			ideological education and rectification of style of work. </span>&#13;
