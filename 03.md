			共产主义是无产阶级的整个思想体系，同时又是一种新的社会制度。这种思想体系和社会制度，是区别于任何别的思想体系和任何别的社会制度的，是自有人类历史以来，最完全最进步最革命最合理的。封建主义的思想体系和社会制度，是进了历史博物馆的东西了。资本主义的思想体系和社会制度，已有一部分进了博物馆（在苏联）；其余部分，也已“日薄西山，气息奄奄，人命危浅，朝不虑夕”，快进博物馆了。惟独共产主义的思想体系和社会制度，正以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，磅礴于全世界，而葆其美妙之青春。<br/>&#13;

			Communism is at once a complete system of proletarian ideology and a &#13;

			social system, and is the most complete, progressive, revolutionary &#13;
			and rational system in human history. The ideological and social &#13;
			system of feudalism has a place only in the museum of history. The &#13;
			ideological and social system of capitalism has also become a museum &#13;

			countries it resembles "a dying person who is sinking fast, like the &#13;
			sun setting beyond the western hills", and will soon be relegated to &#13;

			社会主义革命的目的是为了解放生产力。农业和手工业由个体所有制变为社会主义的集体所有制，私营工商业由资本主义所有制变为社会主义所有制，必然使生产力大大地获得解放。这样就为大大地发展工业和农业的生产创造了社会条件。<br/>&#13;

			我们现在不但正在进行关于社会制度方面的由私有制到公有制的革命，而且正在进行技术方面的由手工业生产到大规模现代化机器生产的革命，而这两种革命是结合在一起的。在农业方面，在我国的条件下（资本主义国家内是使农业资本主义化），则必须先有合作化，然后才能使用大机器。由此可见，我们对于工业和农业、社会主义的工业化和社会主义的农业改造这样两件事，决不可以分割起来和互相孤立起来去看，决不可以只强调一方面，减弱另一方面。<br/>&#13;

			在最近几年中间，农村中的资本主义自发势力一天一天地在发展，新富农已经到处出现，许多富裕中农力求把自己变为富农。许多贫农，则因为生产资料不足，仍然处于贫困地位，有些人欠了债，有些人出卖土地，或者出租土地。这种情况如果让它发展下去，农村中向两极分化的现象必然一天一天地严重起来。失去土地的农民和继续处于贫困地位的农民将要埋怨我们，他们将说我们见死不救，不去帮助他们解决困难。向资本主义方向发展的那些富裕中农也将对我们不满，因为我们如果不想走资本主义的道路的话，就永远不能满足这些农民的要求。在这种情况之下，工人和农民的同盟能够继续巩固下去吗？显然是不能够的。这个问题，只有在新的基础之上才能获得解决。这就是在逐步地实现社会主义工业化和逐步地实现对于手工业、对于资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的同时，逐步地实现对于整个农业的社会主义的改造，即实行合作化，在农村中消灭富农经济制度和个体经济制度，使全体农村人民共同富裕起来。我们认为只有这样，工人和农民的联盟才能获得巩固。<br/>&#13;

			living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with &#13;
			some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this &#13;
			tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will &#13;
			inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their &#13;

			dictatorship for? Its first function is to suppress the reactionary &#13;
			classes and elements and those exploiters in our country who resist &#13;
			the socialist revolution, to suppress those who try to wreck our &#13;
			socialist construction, or in other words, to resolve the internal &#13;
			contradictions between ourselves and the enemy. For instance, to &#13;
			arrest, try and sentence certain counterrevolutionaries, and to &#13;
			deprive landlords and bureaucrat-capitalists of their right to vote &#13;
			and their freedom of speech for a specified period of time - all &#13;
			this comes within the scope of our dictatorship. To maintain public &#13;
			order and safeguard the interests of the people, it is likewise &#13;
			necessary to exercise dictatorship over embezzlers, swindlers, &#13;
			arsonists, murderers, criminal gangs and other scoundrels who &#13;
			seriously disrupt public order. The second function of this &#13;
			dictatorship is to protect our country from subversion and possible &#13;
			aggression by external enemies. In that event, it is the task of &#13;
			this dictatorship to resolve the external contradiction between &#13;
			ourselves and the enemy. The aim of this dictatorship is to protect &#13;
			all our people so that they can devote themselves to peaceful labour &#13;
			and build China into a socialist country with a modern industry, &#13;
			agriculture, science and culture.<br/>&#13;

			人民民主专政需要工人阶级的领导。因为只有工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。整个革命历史证明，没有工人阶级的领导，革命就要失败，有了工人阶级的领导，革命就胜利了。<br/>&#13;

			The people's democratic dictatorship needs the leadership of the &#13;
			working class. For it is only the working class that is most &#13;
			far-sighted, most selfless and most thoroughly revolutionary. The &#13;
			entire history of revolution proves that without the leadership of &#13;
			the working class revolution fails and that with the leadership of &#13;
			the working class revolution triumphs.<br/>&#13;

			人民民主专政的基础是工人阶级、农民阶级和城市小资产阶级的联盟，而主要是工人和农民的联盟，因为这两个阶级占了中国人口的百分之八十到九十。推翻帝国主义和国民党反动派，主要是这两个阶级的力量。由新民主主义到社会主义，主要依靠这两个阶级的联盟。<br/>&#13;
			――《论人民民主专政》（一九四九年六月三十日），《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一四八三页<br/>&#13;
			The people's democratic dictatorship is based on the alliance of the &#13;
			working class, the peasantry and the urban petty bourgeoisie, and &#13;
			mainly on the alliance of the workers and the peasants, because &#13;
			these two classes comprise 80 to go per cent of China's population. &#13;
			These two classes are the main force in overthrowing imperialism and &#13;
			the Kuomintang reactionaries. The transition from New Democracy to &#13;
			socialism also depends mainly upon their alliance.<br/>&#13;

			阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验，是建设社会主义强大国家的三项伟大革命运动，是使共产党人免除官僚主义、避免修正主义和教条主义，永远立于不败之地的确实保证，是使无产阶级能够和广大劳动群众联合起来，实行民主专政的可靠保证。不然的话，让地、富、反、坏、牛鬼蛇神一齐跑了出来，而我们的干部则不闻不问，有许多人甚至敌我不分，互相勾结，被敌人腐蚀侵袭，分化瓦解，拉出去，打进来，许多工人、农民和知识分子也被敌人软硬兼施，照此办理，那就不要很多时间，少则几年、十几年，多则几十年，就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟，马列主义的党就一定会变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，整个中国就要改变颜色了。请同志们想一想，这是一种多么危险的情景啊！<br/>&#13;

			Class struggle, the struggle for production and scientific &#13;
			experiment are the three great revolutionary movements for building &#13;
			a mighty socialist country. These movements are a sure guarantee &#13;
			that Communists will be free from bureaucracy and immune against &#13;
			revisionism and dogmatism, and will for ever remain invincible. They &#13;
			are a reliable guarantee that the proletariat will be able to unite &#13;
			with the broad working masses and realize a democratic dictatorship. &#13;
			If, in the absence of these movements, the landlords, rich peasants, &#13;
			counterrevolutionaries, bad elements and monsters were all allowed &#13;
			to crawl out, while our cadres were to shut their eyes to all this &#13;
			and in many cases fail even to differentiate between the enemy and &#13;
			ourselves but were to collaborate with the enemy and were corrupted, &#13;
			divided and demoralized by him, if our cadres were thus pulled out &#13;
			or the enemy were able to sneak in, and if many of our workers, &#13;
			peasants, and intellectuals were left defenceless against both the &#13;
			soft and the hard tactics of the enemy, then it would not take long, &#13;
			perhaps only several years or a decade, or several decades at most, &#13;
			before a counterrevolutionary restoration on a national scale &#13;
			inevitably occurred, the Marxist-Leninist party would undoubtedly &#13;
			become a revisionist party or a fascist party, and the hole of China &#13;

			人民民主专政有两个方法。对敌人说来是用专政的方法，就是说在必要的时期内，不让他们参与政治活动，强迫他们服从人民政府的法律，强迫他们从事劳动并在劳动中改造他们成为新人。对人民说来则与此相反，不是用强迫的方法，而是用民主的方法，就是说必须让他们参与政治活动，不是强迫他们做这样做那样，而是用民主的方法向他们进行教育和说服的工作。<br/>&#13;

			The people's democratic dictatorship uses two methods. Towards the &#13;
			enemy, it uses the method of dictatorship, that is, for as long a &#13;
			period of time as is necessary it does not let them take part in &#13;
			political activities and compels them to obey the law of the &#13;
			People's Government and to engage in labour and, through labour, &#13;
			transform themselves into new men. Towards the people, on the &#13;
			contrary, it uses the method not of compulsion but of democracy, &#13;
			that is, it must necessarily let them take part in political &#13;
			activities and does not compel them to do this or that, but uses the &#13;
			method of democracy in educating and persuading them.<br/>&#13;

			为了在更加巩固的基础上迅速发展中国的社会主义事业，中国人民正在共产党的领导之下进行一个生气勃勃的整风运动。这就是在城市和农村中对于社会主义和资本主义两条道路、国家的根本制度和重大政策、党政工作人员的工作作风、人民的生活福利等项问题，用摆事实讲道理的方法，有领导地自由地展开全民性的大辩论，用以正确地解决在人民内部实际存在而为当前所必需解决的各项矛盾问题。这是一个社会主义的人民自我教育、自我改造的运动。<br/>&#13;

			Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese people are &#13;
			carrying out a vigorous rectification movement in order to bring &#13;
			about the rapid development of socialism in China on a firmer basis. &#13;
			It is a movement for carrying out a nation-wide debate which is both &#13;
			guided and free, a debate in the city and the countryside on such &#13;
			questions as the socialist road versus the capitalist road, the &#13;
			basic system of the state and its major policies, the working style &#13;
			of Party and government functionaries, and the question of the &#13;
			welfare of the people, a debate which is conducted by setting forth &#13;
			facts and reasoning things out, so as correctly to resolve those &#13;
			actual contradictions among the people which demand immediate &#13;
			solution. This is a socialist movement for the self-education and &#13;

			为了进行伟大的建设工作，在我们的面前，摆着极为繁重的任务。虽然我们有一千多万党员，但是在全国人口中仍然只占极少数。在我们的各个国家机关和各项社会事业中，大量的工作要依靠党外的人员来作。如果我们不善于依靠人民群众，不善于同党外的人员合作，那就无法把工作做好。在我们继续加强全党的团结的时候，我们还必须继续加强各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体的团结，继续巩固和扩大我们的人民民主统一战线，必须认真地纠正在任何工作环节上的任何一种妨害党同人民团结的不良现象。<br/>&#13;
