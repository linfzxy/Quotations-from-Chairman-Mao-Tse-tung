			我们的军队一向就有两条方针：第一对敌人要狠，要压倒它，要消灭它；第二对自己人、对人民、对同志、对官长、对部下要和，要团结。<br/>&#13;
			――《在中央招待留守兵团学习代表时的演说》（一九四四年九月十八日），一九四四年九月二十三日延安《解放日报》<br/>&#13;
			Our army has always had two policies. First, we must be ruthless to &#13;
			our enemies, we must overpower and annihilate them. Second, we must &#13;
			be kind to our own, to the people, to our comrades and to our &#13;
			superiors and subordinates, and unite with them.<br/>&#13;
			D "Speech at the reception given by the Central Committee of the &#13;
			Party for model study delegates from the Rear Army Detachments" &#13;

			我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。……我们的干部要关心每一个战士，一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。<br/>&#13;
			――《为人民服务》（一九四四年九月八日），《毛泽东选集》第三卷第一零零三――一零零四页<br/>&#13;
			We hail from all corners of the country and have joined together for &#13;
			a common revolutionary objective.... Our cadres must show concern &#13;
			for every soldier, and all people in the revolutionary ranks must &#13;
			care for each other, must love and help each other.<br/>&#13;

			应在每一部队内部举行拥干爱兵运动，号召干部爱护士兵，同时号召士兵拥护干部，彼此的缺点错误，公开讲明，迅速纠正，这样就能达到很好地团结内部之目的。<br/>&#13;
			――《一九四五年的任务》（一九四四年十二月十五日），一九四四年十二月十六日延安《解放日报》<br/>&#13;
			A movement to support the cadres and cherish the soldiers should be &#13;
			launched in every army unit, calling on the cadres to cherish the &#13;
			soldiers and the soldiers to support the cadres. They should speak &#13;
			up about each other's shortcomings and mistakes and quickly correct &#13;
			them. In this way they will be able to achieve a very good internal &#13;
			unity.<br/>&#13;

			很多人对于官兵关系、军民关系弄不好，以为是方法不对，我总告诉他们是根本态度（或根本宗旨）问题，这态度就是尊重士兵和尊重人民。从这态度出发，于是有各种的政策、方法、方式。离了这态度，政策、方法、方式也一定是错的，官兵之间、军民之间的关系便决然弄不好。军队政治工作的三大原则：第一是官兵一致，第二是军民一致，第三是瓦解敌军。这些原则要实行有效，都须从尊重士兵、尊重人民和尊重已经放下武器的敌军俘虏的人格这种根本态度出发。那些认为不是根本态度问题而是技术问题的人，实在是想错了，应该加以改正才对。<br/>&#13;
			――《论持久战》（一九三八年五月），《毛泽东选集》第二卷第五零一页<br/>&#13;
			Many people think that it is wrong methods that make for strained &#13;
			relations between officers and men and between the army and the &#13;
			people, but I always tell them that it is a question of basic &#13;
			attitude (or basic principle), of having respect for the soldiers &#13;
			and the people. It is from this attitude that the various policies, &#13;
			methods and forms ensue. If we depart from this attitude, then the &#13;
			policies, methods and forms will certainly be wrong, and the &#13;
			relations between officers and men and between the army and the &#13;
			people are bound to be unsatisfactory. Our three major principles &#13;
			for the army's political work are, first, unity between officers and &#13;
			men; second, unity between the army and the people; and third, the &#13;
			disintegration of the enemy forces. To apply these principles &#13;
			effectively, we must start with this basic attitude of respect for &#13;
			the soldiers and the people, and of respect for the human dignity of &#13;
			prisoners of war once they have laid down their arms. Those who take &#13;
			all this as a technical matter and not one of basic attitude are &#13;
			indeed wrong, and they should correct their view.<br/>&#13;

			共产党人在劳动人民中间进行工作的时候必须采取民主的说服教育的方法，决不允许采取命令主义态度和强制手段。中国共产党忠实地遵守马克思列宁主义的这个原则。<br/>&#13;
			――《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》（一九五七年二月二十七日），人民出版社版第八页<br/>&#13;
			Communists must use the democratic method of persuasion and &#13;
			education when working among the labouring people and must on no &#13;
			account resort to commandism or coercion. The Chinese Communist &#13;
			Party faithfully adheres to this Marxist-Leninist principle.<br/>&#13;

			我们的同志一定要懂得，思想改造的工作是长期的、耐心的、细致的工作，不能企图上几次课，开几次会，就把人家在几十年生活中间形成的思想意识改变过来。要人家服，只能说服，不能压服。压服的结果总是压而不服。以力服人是不行的。对付敌人可以这样，对付同志，对付朋友，绝不能用这个方法。<br/>&#13;
			――《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》（一九五七年三月十二日），人民出版社版第一七页<br/>&#13;
			Our comrades must understand that ideological remoulding involves &#13;
			long-term, patient and painstaking work, and they must not attempt &#13;
			to change people's ideology, which has been shaped over decades of &#13;
			life, by giving a few lectures or by holding a few meetings. &#13;
			Persuasion, not compulsion, is the only way to convince them. &#13;
			Compulsion will never result in convincing them. To try to convince &#13;
			them by force simply won't work. This kind of method is permissible &#13;
			in dealing with the enemy, but absolutely impermissible in dealing &#13;
			with comrades or friends.<br/>&#13;
			D "Speech at the Chinese Communist Party's National Conference on &#13;
			Propaganda Work" (March 12, 1957), 1st pocket ed., p. 23.<br/>&#13;

			要分清敌我，不能站在敌对的立场用对待敌人的态度来对待同志。必须是满腔热情地用保护人民事业和提高人民觉悟的态度来说话，而不能用嘲笑和攻击的态度来说话。<br/>&#13;
			――《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》（一九五七年三月十二日），人民出版社版第一五――一六页<br/>&#13;
			We must make a distinction between the enemy and ourselves, and we &#13;
			must not adopt an antagonistic stand towards comrades and treat them &#13;
			as we would the enemy. In speaking up, one must have an ardent &#13;
			desire to protect the cause of the people and raise their political &#13;
			consciousness, and there must be no ridiculing or attacking in one's &#13;
			approach.<br/>&#13;
