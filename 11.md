			目前农民运动的兴起是一个极大的问题。很短的时间内，将有几万万农民从中国中部、南部和北部各省起来，其势如暴风骤雨，迅猛异常，无论什么大的力量都将压抑不住。他们将冲决一切束缚他们的罗网，朝着解放的路上迅跑。一切帝国主义、军阀、贪官污吏、土豪劣绅，都将被他们葬入坟墓。一切革命的党派、革命的同志，都将在他们面前受他们的检验而决定弃取。站在他们的前头领导他们呢？还是站在他们的后头指手画脚地批评他们呢？还是站在他们的对面反对他们呢？每个中国人对于这三项都有选择的自由，不过时局将强迫你迅速地选择罢了。<br/>&#13;

			trammels that bind them and rush forward along the road to &#13;
			liberation. They will sweep all the imperialists, warlords, corrupt &#13;
			officials, local tyrants and evil gentry into their graves. Every &#13;
			revolutionary party and every revolutionary comrade will be put to &#13;
			the test, to be accepted or rejected as they decide. There are three &#13;
			alternatives. To march at their head and lead them? To trail behind &#13;

			oppose them? Every Chinese is free to choose, but events will force &#13;

			目前农村中合作化的社会改革的高潮，有些地方已经到来，全国也即将到来。这是五亿多农村人口的大规模的社会主义的革命运动，带有极其伟大的世界意义。我们应当积极地热情地有计划地去领导这个运动，而不是用各种办法去拉它向后退。运动中免不了要出些偏差，这是可以理解的，也是不难纠正的。干部中和农民中存在的缺点或错误，只要我们积极地去帮助他们，就会克服或纠正。<br/>&#13;

			群众中蕴藏了一种极大的社会主义的积极性。那些在革命时期还只会按照常规走路的人们，对于这种积极性一概看不见。他们是瞎子，在他们面前出现的只是一片黑暗。他们有时简直要闹到颠倒是非、混淆黑白的程度。这种人难道我们遇见得还少吗？这些只会循着常规走路的人们，老是对于人民的积极性估计过低。一种新事物出现，他们总是不赞成，首先反对一气。随后就是认输，做一点自我批评。第二种新事物出现，他们又按照这两种态度循环一遍。以后各种新事物出现，都按照这个格式处理。这种人老是被动，在紧要的关头老是止步不前，老是需要别人在他的背上击一猛掌，才肯向前跨进一步。<br/>&#13;

			little self-criticism. But the next time something new appears, they &#13;
			go through the same process all over again. This is their pattern of &#13;
			behaviour in regard to anything and everything new. Such people are &#13;

			我党二十几年来，天天做群众工作，近十几年来，天天讲群众路线。我们历来主张革命要依靠人民群众，大家动手，反对只依靠少数人发号施令。但是在有些同志的工作中间，群众路线仍然不能贯彻，他们还是只靠少数人冷冷清清地做工作。其原因之一，就是他们做一件事情，总不愿意向被领导的人讲清楚，不懂得发挥被领导者的积极性和创造力。他们主观上也要大家动手动脚去做，但是不让大家知道要做的是怎么一回事，应当怎样做法，这样，大家怎么能动起来，事情怎么能够办好？要解决这个问题，根本上当然要从思想上进行群众路线的教育，同时也要教给同志们许多具体办法。<br/>&#13;

			For over twenty years our Party has carried on mass work every day, &#13;
			and for the past dozen years it has talked about the mass line every &#13;
			day. We have always maintained that the revolution must rely on the &#13;
			masses of the people, on everybody's taking a hand, and have opposed &#13;
			relying merely on a few persons issuing orders. The mass line, &#13;
			however, is still not being thoroughly carried out in the work of &#13;
			some comrades; they still rely solely on a handful of people working &#13;
			in solitude. One reason is that, whatever they do, they are always &#13;
			reluctant to explain it to the people they lead and that they do not &#13;
			understand why or how to give play to the initiative and creative &#13;
			energy of those they lead. Subjectively, they too want everyone to &#13;
			take a hand in the work, but they do not let other people know what &#13;
			is to be done or how to do it. That being the case, how can everyone &#13;
			be expected to get moving and how can anything be done well? To &#13;
			solve this problem the basic thing is, of course, to carry out &#13;
			ideological education on the mass line, but at the same time we must &#13;
			teach these comrades many concrete methods of work.<br/>&#13;

			二十四年的经验告诉我们，凡属正确的任务、政策和工作作风，都是和当时当地的群众要求相适合，都是联系群众的；凡属错误的任务、政策和工作作风，都是和当时当地的群众要求不相适合，都是脱离群众的。教条主义、经验主义、命令主义、尾巴主义、宗派主义、官僚主义、骄傲自大的工作态度等项弊病之所以一定不好，一定要不得，如果什么人有了这类弊病一定要改正，就是因为它们脱离群众。<br/>&#13;

			要联系群众，就要按照群众的需要和自愿。一切为群众的工作都要从群众的需要出发，而不是从任何良好的个人愿望出发。有许多时候，群众在客观上虽然有了某种改革的需要，但在他们的主观上还没有这种觉悟，群众还没有决心，还不愿实行改革，我们就要耐心地等待；直到经过我们的工作，群众的多数有了觉悟，有了决心，自愿实行改革，才去实行这种改革，否则就会脱离群众。凡是需要群众参加的工作，如果没有群众的自觉和自愿，就会流于徒有形式而失败。……这里是两条原则：一条是群众的实际上的需要，而不是我们脑子里头幻想出来的需要；一条是群众的自愿，由群众自己下决心，而不是由我们代替群众下决心。<br/>&#13;

			To link oneself with the masses, one must act in accordance with the &#13;

			start from their needs and not from the desire of any individual, &#13;
			however well-intentioned. It often happens that objectively the &#13;
			masses need a certain change, but subjectively they are not yet &#13;
			conscious of the need, not yet willing or determined to make the &#13;
			change. In such cases, we should wait patiently. We should not make &#13;
			the change until, through our work, most of the masses have become &#13;
			conscious of the need and are willing and determined to carry it &#13;
			out. Otherwise we shall isolate ourselves from the masses. Unless &#13;
			they are conscious and willing, any kind of work that requires their &#13;
			participation will turn out to be a mere formality and will fail.... &#13;
			There are two principles here: one is the actual needs of the masses &#13;

			在一切工作中，命令主义是错误的，因为它超过群众的觉悟程度，违反了群众的自愿原则，害了急性病。我们的同志不要以为自己了解了的东西，广大群众也和自己一样都了解了。群众是否已经了解并且是否愿意行动起来，要到群众中去考察才会知道。如果我们这样做，就可以避免命令主义。在一切工作中，尾巴主义也是错误的，因为它落后于群众的觉悟程度，违反了领导群众前进一步的原则，害了慢性病。我们的同志不要以为自己还不了解的东西，群众也一概不了解。许多时候，广大群众跑到我们的前头去了，迫切地需要前进一步了，我们的同志不能做广大群众的领导者，却反映了一部分落后分子的意见，并且将这种落后分子的意见误认为广大群众的意见，做了落后分子的尾巴。<br/>&#13;
