			中国的男子，普通要受三种有系统的权力（指政权、族权、神权――编者）的支配，……至于女子，除受上述三种权力的支配以外，还受男子的支配（夫权）。这四种权力――政权、族权、神权、夫权，代表了全部封建宗法的思想和制度，是束缚中国人民特别是农民的四条极大的绳索。农民在乡下怎样推翻地主的政权，已如前头所述。地主政权，是一切权力的基干。地主政权既被打翻，族权、神权、夫权便一概跟着动摇起来。……夫权这种东西，自来在贫农中就比较地弱一点。因为经济上贫农妇女不能不较富有阶级的女子多参加劳动，所以她们取得对于家事的发言权以至决定权的是比较多些。至近年，农村经济益发破产，男子控制女子的基本条件，业已破坏了。最近农民运动一起，许多地方，妇女跟着组织了乡村女界联合会，妇女抬头的机会已到，夫权便一天一天地动摇起来。总而言之，所有一切封建的宗法的思想和制度，都随着农民权力的升涨而动摇。<br/>&#13;

			A man in China is usually subjected to the domination of three &#13;
			systems of authority [political authority, clan authority and &#13;
			religious authority].... As for women, in addition to being &#13;
			dominated by these three systems of authority, they are also &#13;
			dominated by the men (the authority of the husband). These four &#13;
			authorities - political, clan, religious and masculine - are the &#13;
			embodiment of the whole feudal-patriarchal ideology and system, and &#13;
			are the four thick ropes binding the Chinese people, particularly &#13;
			the peasants. How the peasants have overthrown the political &#13;
			authority of the landlords in the countryside has been described &#13;
			above. The political authority of the landlords is the backbone of &#13;
			all the other systems of authority. With that overturned, the clan &#13;
			authority, the religious authority and the authority of the husband &#13;
			all begin to totter.... As to the authority of the husband, this has &#13;
			always been weaker among the poor peasants because, out of economic &#13;
			necessity, their womenfolk have to do more manual labour than the &#13;
			women of the richer classes and therefore have more say and greater &#13;
			power of decision in family matters. With the increasing bankruptcy &#13;
			of the rural economy in recent years, the basis for men's domination &#13;
			over women has already been undermined. With the rise of the peasant &#13;
			movement, the women in many places have now begun to organize rural &#13;
			women's associations; the opportunity has come for them to lift up &#13;
			their heads, and the authority of the husband is getting shakier &#13;
			every day. In a word, the whole feudal-patriarchal ideology and &#13;
			system is tottering with the growth of the peasants' power.<br/>&#13;

			为了建设伟大的社会主义社会，发动广大的妇女群众参加生产活动，具有极大的意义。在生产中，必须实现男女平等，只有在整个社会的社会主义改造过程中才能实现。 &#13;

			――《妇女走上了劳动战线》一文的按语（一九五五年），《中国农村的社会主义高潮》上册第三五七页<br/>&#13;
			In order to build a great socialist society it is of the utmost &#13;
			importance to arouse the broad masses of women to join in productive &#13;
			activity. Men and women must receive equal pay for equal work in &#13;
			production. Genuine equality between the sexes can only be realized &#13;
			in the process of the socialist transformation of society as a &#13;
			whole.<br/>&#13;

			在合作化以后，许多合作社感到劳动力不足了，有必要发动过去不参加田间劳动的广大的妇女群众参加到劳动战线上去。……中国的妇女是一种伟大的人力资源。必须发掘这种资源，为了建设一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗。<br/>&#13;

			With the completion of agricultural cooperation, many co-operatives &#13;
