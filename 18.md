			国际主义者的共产党员，是否可以同时又是一个爱国主义者呢？我们认为不但是可以的，而且是应该的。爱国主义的具体内容，看在什么样的历史条件之下来决定。有日本侵略者和希特勒的“爱国主义”，有我们的爱国主义。对于日本侵略者和希特勒的所谓“爱国主义，共产党员是必须坚决地反对的。日本共产党人和德国共产党人都是他们国家的战争的失败主义者。用一切方法使日本侵略者和希特勒的战争归于失败，就是日本人民和德国人民的利益；失败得越彻底，就越好。……这是因为日本侵略者和希特勒的战争，不但是损害世界人民的，也是损害其本国人民的。中国的情况则不同，中国是被侵略的国家。因此，中国共产党人必须将爱国主义和国际主义结合起来。我们是国际主义者，我们又是爱国主义者，我们的口号是为保卫祖国反对侵略者而战。对于我们，失败主义是罪恶，争取抗日胜利是责无旁贷的。因为只有为着保卫祖国而战才能打败侵略者，使民族得到解放。只有民族得到解放，才有使无产阶级和劳动人民得到解放的可能。中国胜利了，侵略中国的帝国主义者被打倒了，同时也就是帮助了外国的人民。因此，爱国主义就是国际主义在民族解放战争中的实施。<br/>&#13;

			Can a Communist, who is an internationalist, at the same time be a &#13;
			patriot? We hold that he not only can be but must be. The specific &#13;
			content of patriotism is determined by historical conditions. There &#13;
			is the "patriotism" of the Japanese aggressors and of Hitler, and &#13;
			there is our patriotism. Communists must resolutely oppose the &#13;
			"patriotism" of the Japanese aggressors and of Hitler. The &#13;
			Communists of Japan and Germany are defeatists with regard to the &#13;
			wars being waged by their countries. To bring about the defeat of &#13;
			the Japanese aggressors and of Hitler by every possible means is in &#13;
			the interests of the Japanese and the German people, and the more &#13;
			complete the defeat the better.... For the wars launched by the &#13;
			Japanese aggressors and Hitler are harming the people at home as &#13;
			well as the people of the world. China's case, however, is &#13;
			different, because she is the victim of aggression. Chinese &#13;
			Communists must therefore combine patriotism with internationalism. &#13;
			We are at once internationalists and patriots, and our slogan is, &#13;
			"Fight to defend the motherland against the aggressors." For us &#13;
			defeatism is a crime and to strive for victory in the War of &#13;
			Resistance is an inescapable duty. For only by fighting in defence of &#13;
			the motherland can we defeat the aggressors and achieve national &#13;
			liberation. And only by achieving national liberation will it be &#13;
			possible for the proletariat and other working people to achieve &#13;
			their own emancipation. The victory of China and the defeat of the &#13;
			invading imperialists will help the people of other countries. Thus &#13;
			in wars of national liberation patriotism is applied &#13;
			internationalism.<br/>&#13;

			一个外国人，毫无利已的动机，把中国人民的解放事业当作他自己的事业，这是什么精神？这是国际主义的精神，这是共产主义的精神，每一个中国共产党员都要学习这种精神。……我们要和一切资本主义国家的无产阶级联合起来，要和日本的、英国的、美国的、德国的、意大利的以及一切资本主义国家的无产阶级联合起来，才能打倒帝国主义，解放我们的民族和人民，解放世界的民族和人民。这就是我们的国际主义，这就是我们用以反对狭隘民族主义和狭隘爱国主义的国际主义。<br/>&#13;
			――《纪念白求恩》（一九三九年十二月二十一日），《毛泽东选集》第二卷第六五三页<br/>&#13;
			What kind of spirit is this that makes a foreigner selflessly adopt &#13;
			the cause of the Chinese people's liberation as his own? It is the &#13;
			spirit of internationalism, the spirit of communism, from which &#13;
			every Chinese Communist must learn.... We must unite with the &#13;
			proletariat of all the capitalist countries, with the proletariat of &#13;
			Japan, Britain, the United States, Germany, Italy and all other &#13;
			capitalist countries, before it is possible to overthrow &#13;
			imperialism, to liberate our nation and people, and to liberate the &#13;
			other nations and peoples of the world. This is our &#13;
			internationalism, the internationalism with which we oppose both &#13;
			narrow nationalism and narrow patriotism.<br/>&#13;

			In the fight for complete liberation the oppressed people rely first &#13;

			事物总是发展的。一九一一年的革命，即辛亥革命，到今年，不过四十五年，中国的面目完全变了。再过四十五年，就是二千零一年，也就是进到二十一世纪的时候，中国的面目更要大变。中国将变为一个强大的社会主义工业国。中国应当这样。因为中国是一个具有九百六十万平方公里土地和六万万人口的国家，中国应当对于人类有较大的贡献。而这种贡献，在过去一个长时期内，则是太少了。这使我们感到惭愧。<br/>&#13;
			但是要谦虚。不但现在应当这样，四十五年之后也应当这样，永远应当这样。中国人在国际交往方面，应当坚决、彻底、干净、全部地消灭大国主义。<br/>&#13;
			――《纪念孙中山先生》（一九五六年十一月），一九五六年十一月十二日《人民日报》<br/>&#13;
			Things develop ceaselessly. It is only forty-five years since the &#13;
			Revolution of 19II, but the face of China has completely changed. In &#13;
			another forty-five years, that is, in the year 2001, or the &#13;
			beginning of the 21st century, China will have undergone an even &#13;
			greater change. She will have become a powerful socialist industrial &#13;
			country. And that is as it should be. China is a land with an area &#13;
			of 9,600,000 square kilometres and a population of 600 million &#13;
			people, and she ought to have made a greater contribution to &#13;
			humanity. Her contribution over a long period has been far too &#13;
			small. For this we are regretful.<br/>&#13;
			But we must be modest - not only now, but forty-five years hence as &#13;
			well. We should always be modest. In our international relations, we &#13;
			Chinese people should get rid of great-power chauvinism resolutely, &#13;
			thoroughly, wholly and completely.<br/>&#13;
