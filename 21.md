			我们的方针要放在什么基点上？放在自己力量的基点上，叫做自力更生。我们并不孤立，全世界一切反对帝国主义的国家和人民都是我们的朋友。但是我们强调自力更生，我们能够依靠自己组织的力量，打败一切中外反动派。<br/>&#13;

			organize, we can defeat all Chinese and foreign reactionaries.<br/>&#13;

			夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。……中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。这一点现在就必须向党内讲明白，务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。<br/>&#13;

			我们应当把世界进步的情况和光明的前途，常常向人民宣传，使人民建立起胜利的信心，同时，我们还要告诉人民，告诉同志们，道路是曲折的。在革命的道路上还有许多障碍物，还有许多困难。我们党的七次代表大会设想过许多困难，我们宁肯把困难想得更多一些，有些同志不愿意多想困难。但是困难是事实，有多少就得承认多少，不能采取“不承认主义”。我们要承认困难，分析困难，向困难作斗争。世界上没有直路，要准备走曲折的路，不要贪便宜。不能设想，那一天早上，一切反动派会统统自己跪在地下。总之，前途是光明的，道路是曲折的。我们面前困难还多，不可忽视。我们和全体人民团结起来，共同努力，一定能够排除万难，达到胜利的目的。<br/>&#13;

			中国古代有个寓言，叫做“愚公移山”。说的是古代有一位老人，住在华北，名叫北山愚公。他的家门南面有两座大山挡住他家的出路，一座叫做太行山，一座叫做王屋山。愚公下决心率领他的儿子们要用锄头挖去这两座大山。有个老头子名叫智叟的看了发笑，说是你们这样干未免太愚蠢了，你们父子数人要挖掉这样两座大山是完全不可能的。愚公回答说：我死了以后有我的儿子，儿子死了，又有孙子，子子孙孙是没有穷尽的。这两座山虽然很高，却是不会再增高了，挖一点就会少一点。为什么挖不平呢？愚公批驳了智叟的错误思想，毫不动摇，每天挖山不止。这件事感动了上帝，他就派了两个神仙下凡，把两座山背走了。现在也有两座压在中国人民头上的大山，一座叫做帝国主义，一座叫做封建主义。中国共产党早就下了决心，要挖掉这两座山。我们一定要坚持下去，一定要不断地工作，我们也会感动上帝的。这个上帝不是别人，就是全中国的人民大众。全国人民大众一齐起来和我们一道挖这两座山，有什么挖不平呢？<br/>&#13;

			There is an ancient Chinese fable called "The Foolish Old Man Who &#13;
			Removed the Mountains". It tells of an old man who lived in northern &#13;
			China long, long ago and was known as the Foolish Old Man of North &#13;
			Mountain. His house faced south and beyond his doorway stood the two &#13;
			great peaks, Taihang and Wangwu, obstructing the way. With great &#13;
			determination, he led his sons in digging up these mountains hoe in &#13;
			hand. Another greybeard, known as the Wise Old Man, saw them and &#13;
			said derisively, "How silly of you to do this! It is quite &#13;
			impossible for you few to dig up these two huge mountains." The &#13;
			Foolish Old Man replied, "When I die, my sons will carry on; when &#13;
			they die, there will be my grandsons, and then their sons and &#13;
			grandsons, and so on to infinity. High as they are, the mountains &#13;
			cannot grow any higher and with every bit we dig, they will be that &#13;
			much lower. Why can't we clear them away?" Having refuted the Wise &#13;
			Old Man's wrong view, he went on digging every day, unshaken in his &#13;
			conviction. God was moved by this, and he sent down two angels, who &#13;
			carried the mountains away on their backs. Today, two big mountains &#13;
			lie like a dead weight on the Chinese people. One is imperialism, &#13;
			the other is feudalism. The Chinese Communist Party has long made up &#13;
			its mind to dig them up. We must persevere and work unceasingly, and &#13;
			we, too, will touch God's heart. Our God is none other than the &#13;
			masses of the Chinese people. If they stand up and dig together with &#13;
			us, why can't these two mountains be cleared away?<br/>&#13;
