			因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。因为胜利，人民感谢我们，资产阶级也会出来捧场。敌人的武力是不能征服我们的，这点已经得到证明了。资产阶级的捧场则可能征服我们队伍中的意志薄弱者。可能有这样一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。我们必须预防这种情况。<br/>&#13;

			progress, love of pleasure and distaste for continued hard living. &#13;
			With victory, the people will be grateful to us and the bourgeoisie &#13;
			will come forward to flatter us. It has been proved that the enemy &#13;
			cannot conquer us by force of arms. However, the flattery of the &#13;
			bourgeoisie may conquer the weak-willed in our ranks. There may be &#13;
			some Communists, who were not conquered by enemies with guns and &#13;
			were worthy of the name of heroes for standing up to these enemies, &#13;
			but who cannot withstand sugar-coated bullets; they will be defeated &#13;
			by sugar-coated bullets. We must guard against such a situation.<br/>&#13;

			有许多的东西，只要我们对它们陷入盲目性，缺乏自觉性，就可能成为我们的包袱，成为我们的负担。例如：犯过错误，可以使人觉得自己反正是犯了错误的，从此萎靡不振；未犯错误，也可以使人觉得自己是未犯过错误的，从此骄傲起来。工作无成绩，可以使人悲观丧气；工作有成绩，又可以使人趾高气扬。斗争历史短的，可以因其短而不负责任；斗争历史长的，可以因其长而自以为是。工农分子，可以自己的光荣出身傲视知识分子；知识分子，又可以自己有某些知识傲视工农分子。各种业务专长，都可以成为高傲自大轻视旁人的资本。甚至年龄也可以成为骄傲的工具：青年人可以因为自己聪明能干而看不起老年人，老年人又可以因为自己富有经验而看不起青年人。对于诸如此类的东西，如果没有自觉性，那它们就会成为负担或包袱。<br/>&#13;

			Many things may become baggage, may become encumbrances if we cling &#13;
			to them blindly and uncritically. Let us take some illustrations. &#13;
			Having made mistakes, you may feel that, come what may, you are &#13;
			saddled with them and so become dispirited; if you have not made &#13;
			mistakes, you may feel that you are free from error and so become &#13;
			conceited. Lack of achievement in work may breed pessimism and &#13;
			depression, while achievement may breed pride and arrogance. A &#13;
			comrade with a short record of struggle may shirk responsibility on &#13;
			this account, while a veteran may become opinionated because of his &#13;
			long record of struggle. Worker and peasant comrades, because of &#13;
			pride in their class origin, may look down upon intellectuals, while &#13;
			intellectuals, because they have a certain amount of knowledge, may &#13;
			look down upon worker and peasant comrades. Any specialized skill &#13;
			may be capitalized on and so may lead to arrogance and contempt of &#13;
			others. Even one's age may become ground for conceit. The young, &#13;
			because they are bright and capable, may look down upon the old; and &#13;
			the old, because they are rich in experience, may look down upon the &#13;
			young. All such things become encumbrances or baggage if there is no &#13;
			critical awareness.<br/>&#13;

			艰苦的工作就象担子，摆在我们的面前，看我们敢不敢承担。担子有轻有重。有的人拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己拣轻的挑。这就不是好的态度。有的同志不是这样，享受让给人家，担子拣重的挑，吃苦在别人前头，享受在别人后头。这样的同志就是好同志。这种共产主义者的精神，我们都要学习。<br/>&#13;

			闹这类独立性的人，常常跟他们的个人第一主义分不开，他们在个人和党的关系问题上，往往是不正确的。他们在口头上虽然也说尊重党，但他们在实际上却把个人放在第一位，把党放在第二位。这种人闹什么东西呢？闹名誉，闹地位，闹出风头。在他们掌管一部分事业的时候，就要闹独立性。为了这些，就要拉拢一些人，排挤一些人，在同志中吹吹拍拍，拉拉扯扯，把资产阶级政党的庸俗作风也搬进共产党里来了。这种人的吃亏在于不老实。我想，我们应该是老老实实地办事；在世界上要办成几件事，没有老实态度是根本不行的。<br/>&#13;

			of the relationship between the individual and the Party. Although &#13;
			in words they profess respect for the Party, in practice they put &#13;
			themselves first and the Party second. What are these people after? &#13;
			They are after fame and position and want to be in the limelight. &#13;

			others out and resort to boasting, flattery and touting among-the &#13;
			comrades, thus importing the vulgar style of the bourgeois political &#13;
			parties into the Communist Party. It is their dishonesty that causes &#13;

			共产党员必须懂得以局部需要服从全局需要这一个道理。如果某项意见在局部的情形看来是可行的，而在全局的情形看来是不可行的，就应以局部服从全局。反之也是一样，在局部的情形看来是不可行的，而在全局的情形看来是可行的，也应以局部服从全局。这就是照顾全局的观点。<br/>&#13;

			自由主义有各种表现。<br/>&#13;
			因为是熟人、同乡、同学、知心朋友、亲爱者、老同事、老部下，明知不对，也不同他们作原则上的争论，任其下去，求得和平和亲热。或者轻描淡写地说一顿，不作彻底解决，保持一团和气。结果是有害于团体，也有害于个人。这是第一种。<br/>&#13;
			不负责任的背后批评，不是积极地向组织建议。当面不说，背后乱说；开会不说，会后乱说。心目中没有集体生活的原则，只有自由放任。这是第二种。<br/>&#13;
			事不关己，高高挂起；明知不对，少说为佳；明哲保身，但求无过。这是第三种。<br/>&#13;
			命令不服从，个人意见第一。只要组织照顾，不要组织纪律。这是第四种。<br/>&#13;
			不是为了团结，为了进步，为了把事情弄好，向不正确的意见斗争和争论，而是个人攻击，闹意气，泄私愤，图报复。这是第五种。<br/>&#13;
			听了不正确的议论也不争辩，甚至听了反革命分子的话也不报告，泰然处之，行若无事。这是第六种。<br/>&#13;
			见群众不宣传，不鼓动，不演说，不调查，不询问，不关心其痛痒，漠然置之，忘记了自己是一个共产党员，把一个共产党员混同于一个普通的老百姓。这是第七种。<br/>&#13;
			见损害群众利益的行为不愤恨，不劝告，不制止，不解释，听之任之。这是第八种。<br/>&#13;
			办事不认真，无一定计划，无一定方向，敷衍了事，得过且过，做一天和尚撞一天钟。这是第九种。<br/>&#13;

			Liberalism manifests itself in various ways.<br/>&#13;
			To let things slide for the sake of peace and friendship when a &#13;
			person has clearly gone wrong, and refrain from principled argument &#13;
			because he is an old acquaintance, a fellow townsman, a schoolmate, &#13;
			a close friend, a loved one, an old colleague or old subordinate. Or &#13;
			to touch on the matter lightly instead of going into it thoroughly, &#13;
			so as to keep on good terms. The result is that both the &#13;
			organization and the individual are harmed. This is one type of &#13;
			liberalism.<br/>&#13;
			To indulge in irresponsible criticism in private instead of actively &#13;
			putting forward one's suggestions to the organization. To say &#13;
			nothing to people to their faces but to gossip behind their backs, &#13;
			or to say nothing at a meeting but to gossip afterwards. To show no &#13;
			regard at all for the principles of collective life but to follow &#13;
			one's own inclination. This is a second type.<br/>&#13;
			To let things drift if they do not affect one personally; to say as &#13;
			little as possible while knowing perfectly well what is wrong, to be &#13;
			worldly wise and play safe and seek only to avoid blame. This is a &#13;
			third type.<br/>&#13;
			Not to obey orders but to give pride of place to one's own opinions. &#13;
			To demand special consideration from the organization but to reject &#13;
			its discipline. This is a fourth type.<br/>&#13;
			To indulge in personal attacks, pick quarrels, vent personal spite &#13;
			or seek revenge instead of entering into an argument and struggling &#13;
			against incorrect views for the sake of unity or progress or getting &#13;
			the work done properly. This is a fifth type.<br/>&#13;
			To hear incorrect views without rebutting them and even to hear &#13;
			counter-revolutionary remarks without reporting them, but instead to &#13;
			take them calmly as if nothing had happened. This is a sixth type.<br/>&#13;
			To be among the masses and fail to conduct propaganda and agitation &#13;
			or speak at meetings or conduct investigations and inquiries among &#13;
			them, and instead to be indifferent to them and show no concern for &#13;
			their well-being, forgetting that one is a Communist and behaving as &#13;
			if one were an ordinary non-Communist. This is a seventh type.<br/>&#13;
			To see someone harming the interests of the masses and yet not feel &#13;
			indignant, or dissuade or stop him or reason with him, but to allow &#13;
			him to continue. This is an eighth type.<br/>&#13;
			To work half-heartedly without a definite plan or direction; to work &#13;
			perfunctorily and muddle along - "So long as one remains a monk, one &#13;
			goes on tolling the bell." This is a ninth type.<br/>&#13;
			To regard oneself as having rendered great service to the &#13;
			revolution, to pride oneself on being a veteran, to disdain minor &#13;
			assignments while being quite unequal to major tasks, to be slipshod &#13;
			in work and slack in study. This is a tenth type.<br/>&#13;
			To be aware of one's own mistakes and yet make no attempt to correct &#13;
			them, taking a liberal attitude towards oneself. This is an eleventh &#13;
			type.<br/>&#13;

			革命的集体组织中的自由主义是十分有害的。它是一种腐蚀剂，使团结涣散，关系松懈，工作消极，意见分歧。它使革命队伍失掉严密的组织和纪律，政策不能贯彻到底，党的组织和党所领导的群众发生隔离。这是一种严重的恶劣倾向。<br/>&#13;
			――《反对自由主义》（一九三七年九月七日），《毛泽东选集》第二卷第三四八页<br/>&#13;
			Liberalism is extremely harmful in a revolutionary collective. It is &#13;
			a corrosive which eats away unity, undermines cohesion, causes &#13;
			apathy and creates dissension. It robs the revolutionary ranks of &#13;

			being carried through and alienates the Party organizations from the &#13;

			Marxism, but they have their liberalism as well - they talk Marxism &#13;
			but practise liberalism; they apply Marxism to others but liberalism &#13;
