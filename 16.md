			我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。<br/>&#13;
			――《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》（一九五七年二月二十七日），人民出版社版第二三页<br/>&#13;
			Our educational policy must enable everyone who receives an &#13;
			education to develop morally, intellectually and physically and &#13;
			become a worker with both socialist consciousness and culture.<br/>&#13;

			<br/>&#13;
			对于在职干部的教育和干部学校的教育，应确立以研究中国革命实际问题为中心，以马克思列宁主义基本原则为指导的方针，废除静止地孤立地研究马克思列宁主义的方法。<br/>&#13;
			――《改造我们的学习》（一九四一年五月），《毛泽东选集》第三卷第八零三页<br/>&#13;
			As for education for cadres whether at work or in schools for &#13;
			cadres, a policy should be established of focusing such education on &#13;
			the study of the practical problems of the Chinese revolution and &#13;
			using the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism as the guide, and the &#13;
			method of studying Marxism-Leninism statically and in isolation &#13;
			should be discarded.<br/>&#13;

			<br/>&#13;
			一个军事学校，最重要的问题，是选择校长教员和规定教育方针。<br/>&#13;
			――《中国革命战争的战略问题》（一九三六年十二月），《毛泽东选集》第一卷第一七零页<br/>&#13;
			For a military school, the most important question is the selection &#13;
			of a director and instructors and the adoption of an educational &#13;
			policy.<br/>&#13;
			D "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War" (December &#13;
			1936), Selected Works, Vol. I, p. 185.*<br/>&#13;
			<br/>&#13;
			一个百人的学校，如果没有一个从教员中、职员中、学生中按照实际形成的（不是勉强凑集的）最积极最正派最机敏的几个人乃至十几个人的领导骨干，这个学校就一定办不好。<br/>&#13;
			――《关于领导方法的若干问题》（一九四三年六月一日），《毛泽东选集》第三卷第九零一页<br/>&#13;
			A school of a hundred people certainly cannot be run well if it does &#13;
			not have a leading group of several people, or a dozen or more, &#13;
			which is formed in accordance with the actual circumstances (and not &#13;
			thrown together artificially) and is composed of the most active, &#13;
			upright and alert of the teachers, the other staff and the students.<br/>&#13;
			D "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership" (June 1, 1943), &#13;
			Selected Works, Vol. III, pp. 118-l9.<br/>&#13;

			我全军将士必须提高军事艺术，在必胜的战争中勇猛前进，坚决彻底干净全部地歼灭一切敌人。<br/>&#13;
			――《中国人民解放军宣言》（一九四七年十月），《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一二三九页<br/>&#13;
			All officers and fighters of our army must improve their military &#13;
			art, march forward courageously towards certain victory in the war &#13;
			and resolutely, thoroughly, wholly and completely wipe out all &#13;
			enemies.<br/>&#13;
			D "Manifesto of the Chinese People's Liberation Army" (October &#13;
			1947), Selected Military Writings, 2nd ed., p. 340.<br/>&#13;
			<br/>&#13;
			目前开始的一年整训计划，军事整训与政治整训应该并重，并使二者互相结合。整训开始时，还应着重政治方面，着重于改善官兵关系，增强内部团结，发动干部与战士群众的高度积极性，军事整训才易于实施与更有效果。<br/>&#13;
			――《一九四五年的任务》（一九四四年十二月十五日），一九四四年十二月十六日延安《解放日报》<br/>&#13;
			Equal importance should be attached to the military and political &#13;
			aspects of the one-year consolidation and training programme which &#13;
			has just begun, and the two aspects should be integrated. At the &#13;
			start, stress should be placed on the political aspect, on improving &#13;
			relations between officers and men, enhancing internal unity and &#13;
			arousing a high level of enthusiasm among the masses of cadres and &#13;
			fighters. Only thus will the military consolidation and training &#13;
			proceed smoothly and attain better results.<br/>&#13;
			D "The Tasks for 1945" (December 15, 1944).<br/>&#13;
			<br/>&#13;
			练兵方法，应开展官教兵、兵教官、兵教兵的群众练兵运动。<br/>&#13;
			――《一九四六年解放区工作的方针》（一九四五年十二月十五日），《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一一七二页<br/>&#13;
			As for the method of training, we should unfold the mass training &#13;
			movement in which officers teach soldiers, soldiers teach officers &#13;
			and the soldiers teach each other.<br/>&#13;
			D "Policy for Work in the Liberated Areas for 1946" (December 15, &#13;
			1945), Selected Works, Vol. IV, p. 76.<br/>&#13;
			<br/>&#13;
			我们练兵的口号是：“官教兵，兵教官，兵教兵。”战士们有很多打仗的实际经验。当官的要向战士学习，把别人的经验变成自己的，他的本领就大了。<br/>&#13;
			――《对晋绥日报编辑人员的谈话》（一九四入年四月二日），《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一三一九页<br/>&#13;
			Our slogan in training troops is, "Officers teach soldiers, soldiers &#13;
			teach officers and soldiers teach each other". The fighters have a &#13;
			lot of practical combat experience. The officers should learn from &#13;
			the fighters, and when they have made other people's experience their &#13;
			own, they will become more capable.<br/>&#13;
			D "A Talk to the Editorial Staff of the Shansi-Suiyuan Daily" (April &#13;
			2, 1948), Selected Works, Vol. IV, p. 243.<br/>&#13;
			<br/>&#13;
			练兵项目，仍以提高射击、刺杀、投弹等项技术程度为主，提高战术程度为辅，特别着重于练习夜战。<br/>&#13;
			――《一九四六年解放区工作的方针政策》（一九四五年十二月十五日），《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一一七二页<br/>&#13;
			As for the training courses, the main objective should still be to &#13;
			raise the level of technique in marksmanship, bayoneting &#13;
			grenade-throwing and the like and the secondary objective should be &#13;
			to raise the level of tactics, while special emphasis should be laid &#13;
			on night operations.<br/>&#13;
