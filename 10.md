			党委制是保证集体领导、防止个人包办的党的重要制度。近查有些（当然不是一切）领导机关，个人包办和个人解决重要问题的习气甚为浓厚。重要问题的解决，不是由党委会议做决定，而是由个人做决定，党委委员等于虚设。委员间意见分歧以的事亦无由解决，并且听任这些分歧长期地不加解决。党委委员间所保持的只是形式上的一致，而不是实质上的一致。此种情形必须加以改变。今后从中央局至地委，从前委至旅委以及军区（军分会或领导小组）、政府党组、民众团体党组、通讯社和报社党组，都必须建立健全的党委会议制度，一切重要问题（当然不是无关重要的小问题或者已经会议讨论解决只待执行的问题）均须交委员会讨论，由到会委员充分发表意见，做出明确决定，然后分别执行。……委员会又须分别为常委会和全体会两种，不可混在一起。此外，还须注意，集体领导和个人负责，二者不可偏废。军队在作战时和情况需要时，首长有临机处置之权。<br/>&#13;

			The Party committee system is an important Party institution for &#13;
			ensuring collective leadership and preventing any individual from &#13;
			monopolizing the conduct of affairs. It has recently been found that &#13;
			in some (of course not all) leading bodies it is the habitual &#13;
			practice for one individual to monopolize the conduct of affairs and &#13;
			decide important problems. Solutions to important problems are &#13;
			decided not by Party committee meetings but by one individual, and &#13;
			membership in the Party committee has become nominal. Differences of &#13;
			opinion among committee members cannot be resolved and are left &#13;
			unresolved for a long time. Members of the Party committee maintain &#13;
			only formal, not real, unity among themselves. This situation must &#13;
			be changed. From now on, a sound system of Party committee meetings &#13;
			must be instituted in all leading bodies, from the regional bureaus &#13;
			of the Central Committee to the prefectural Party committees; from &#13;
			the Party committees of the fronts to the Party committees of &#13;
			brigades and military areas (sub-commissions of the Revolutionary &#13;
			Military Commission or leading groups); and the leading Party &#13;
			members' groups in government bodies, people's organizations the &#13;
			news agency and the newspaper offices. All important problems (of &#13;
			course, not the unimportant, trivial problems, or problems whose &#13;
			solutions have already been decided after discussion at meetings and &#13;
			need only be carried out) must be submitted to the committee for &#13;
			discussion, and the committee members present should express their &#13;
			views fully and reach definite decisions which should then be &#13;
			carried out by the members concerned.... Party committee meetings &#13;
			must be divided into two categories, standing committee meetings and &#13;
			plenary sessions, and the two should not be confused. Furthermore, &#13;
			we must take care that neither collective leadership nor personal &#13;
			responsibility is overemphasized to the neglect of the other. In the &#13;
			army, the person in command has the right to make emergency &#13;
			decisions during battle and when circumstances require.<br/>&#13;

			党委书记要善于当“班长”。党的委员会有一二十个人，象军队的一个班，书记好比是“班长”。要把这个班带好，的确不容易。目前各中央局、分局都领导很大的地区，担负很繁重的任务。领导工作不仅要决定方针政策，还要制定正确的工作方法。有了正确的方针政策，如果在工作方法上疏忽了，还是要发生问题。党委要完成自己的领导任务，就必须依靠党委这“一班人”，充分发挥他们的作用。书记要当好“班长”，就应该很好地学习和研究。书记、副书记如果不注意向自己的“一班人”作宣传工作和组织工作，不善于研究怎样把会议开好，就很难把这“一班人”指挥好。如果这“一班人”动作不整齐，就休想带领千百万人去作战，去建设。当然，书记和委员之间的关系是少数服从多数，这同班长和战士之间的关系是不一样的。这里不过是一个比方。<br/>&#13;
			――《党委会的工作方法》（一九四九年三月十三日），《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一四四一页<br/>&#13;
			The secretary of a Party committee must be good at being a "squad &#13;
			leader". A Party committee has ten to twenty members; it is like a &#13;
			squad in the army, and the secretary is like the "squad leader". It &#13;
			is indeed not easy to lead this squad well. Each regional bureau or &#13;
			sub-regional bureau of the Central Committee now leads a vast area &#13;
			and shoulders very heavy responsibilities. To lead means not only to &#13;
			decide general and specific policies but also to devise correct &#13;
			methods of work. Even with correct general and specific policies, &#13;
			troubles may still arise if methods of work are neglected. To fulfill &#13;
			its task of exercising leadership, a Party committee must rely on &#13;
			its "squad members" and enable them to play their parts to the full. &#13;
			To be a good "squad leader", the secretary should study hard and &#13;
			investigate thoroughly. A secretary or deputy secretary will find it &#13;
			difficult to direct his "squad" well if he does not take care to do &#13;
			propaganda and organizational work among his own "squad members'', &#13;
			is not good at handling his relations with committee members or does &#13;
			not study how to run meetings successfully. If the "squad members" &#13;
			do not march in step, they can never expect to lead tens of millions &#13;
			of people in fighting and construction. Of course, the relation &#13;
			between the secretary and the committee members is one in which the &#13;
			minority must obey the majority, so it is different from the &#13;
			relation between a squad leader and his men. Here we speak only by &#13;
			way of analogy.<br/>&#13;

			Works, Vol. IV, p. 377.*<br/>&#13;

			要把问题摆到桌面上来。不仅“班长”要这样做，委员也要这样做。不要在背后议论。有了问题就开会，摆到桌面上来讨论，规定它几条，问题就解决了。有问题而不摆到桌面上来，就会长期不得解决，甚至一拖几年。“班长”和委员还要能互相谅解。书记和委员，中央和各中央局，各中央局和区党委之间的谅解、支援和友谊，比什么都重要。<br/>&#13;

			Place problems on the table. This should be done not only by the &#13;
			"squad leader" but by the committee members too. Do not talk behind &#13;
			people's backs. Whenever problems arise, call a meeting, place the &#13;
			problems on the table for discussion, take some decisions and the &#13;
			problems will be solved. If problems exist and are not placed on the &#13;
			table, they will remain unsolved for a long time and even drag on &#13;
			for years. The "squad leader" and the committee members should show &#13;
			understanding in their relations with each other. Nothing is more &#13;
			important than mutual understanding, support and friendship between &#13;
			the secretary and the committee members, between the Central &#13;
			Committee and its regional bureaus and between the regional bureaus &#13;
			and the area Party committees.<br/>&#13;

			“互通情报”。就是说，党委各委员之间要把彼此知道的情况互相通知、互相交流。这对于取得共同的语言是很重要的。有些人不是这样做，而是象老子说的“鸡犬之声相闻，老死不相往来”，结果彼此之间就缺乏共同的语言。<br/>&#13;
			――《党委会的工作方法》（一九四九年三月十三日），《毛泽东选集》第四卷第四四二页<br/>&#13;
			"Exchange information." This means that members of a Party committee &#13;
			should keep each other informed and exchange views on matters that &#13;
			have come to their attention. This is of great importance in &#13;
			achieving a common language. Some fail to do so and, like the people &#13;
			described by Lao Tzu, "do not visit each other all their lives, &#13;
			though the crowing of their cocks and the barking of their dogs are &#13;
			within hearing of each other". The result is that they lack a common &#13;
			language.<br/>&#13;
			D Ibid., p. 378.<br/>&#13;
			<br/>&#13;
			不懂得和不了解的东西要问下级，不要轻易表示赞成或反对。……我们切不可强不知以为知，要“不耻下问”，要善于倾听下面干部的意见。先做学生，然后再做先生；先向下面干部请教，然后再下命令。……下面干部的话，有正确的，也有不正确的，听了以后要加以分析。对正确的意见，必须听，并且照它做。……对下面来的错误意见也要听，根本不听是不对的；不过听了而不照它做，并且要给以批评。<br/>&#13;

			Ask your subordinates about matters you don't understand or don't &#13;
			know, and do not lightly express your approval or disapproval.... We &#13;
			should never pretend to know what we don't know, we should "not feel &#13;
			ashamed to ask and learn from people below" and we should listen &#13;
			carefully to the views of the cadres at the lower levels. Be a pupil &#13;
			before you become a teacher; learn from the cadres at the lower &#13;
			levels before you issue orders.... What the cadres at the lower &#13;
			levels say may or may not be correct, after hearing it, we must &#13;
			analyse it. We must heed the correct views and act upon them.... &#13;
			Listen also to the mistaken views from below, it is wrong not to &#13;
			listen to them at all. Such views, however, are not to be acted upon &#13;
			but to be criticized.<br/>&#13;
			D Ibid., pp. 378-79*<br/>&#13;
			<br/>&#13;
			学会“弹钢琴”。弹钢琴要十个指头都动作，不能有的动，有的不动。但是，十个指头同时都按下去，那也不成调子。要产生好的音乐，十个指头的动作要有节奏，要互相配合。党委要抓紧中心工作，又要围绕中心工作而同时开展其他方面的工作。我们现在管的方面很多，各地、各军、各部门的工作，都要照顾到，不能只注意一部分问题而把别的丢掉。凡是有问题的地方都要点一下，这个方法我们一定要学会。钢琴有人弹得好，有人弹得不好，这两种人弹出来的调子差别很大。党委的同志必须学好“弹钢琴”。<br/>&#13;
			――《党委会的工作方法》（一九四九年三月十三日），《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一四四三页<br/>&#13;
			Learn to "play the piano". In playing the piano all ten fingers are &#13;
			in motion; it won't do to move some fingers only and not others. But &#13;
			if all ten fingers press down at once, there is no melody. To &#13;
			produce good music, the ten fingers should move rhythmically and in &#13;
			co-ordination. A Party committee should keep a firm grasp on its &#13;
			central task and at the same time, around the central task, it &#13;
			should unfold the work in other fields. At present, we have to take &#13;
			care of many fields; we must look after the work in all the areas, &#13;
			armed units and departments, and not give all our attention to a few &#13;
			problems, to the exclusion of others. Wherever there is a problem, &#13;
			we must put our finger on it, and this is a method we must master. &#13;
			Some play the piano well and some badly, and there is a great &#13;
			difference in the melodies they produce. Members of Party committees &#13;
			must learn to "play the piano" well.<br/>&#13;
			D Ibid., p. 379.<br/>&#13;
			<br/>&#13;
			要“抓紧”。就是说，党委对主要工作不但一定要“抓”，而且一定要“抓紧”。什么东西只有抓得很紧，毫不放松，才能抓住。抓而不紧，等于不抓。伸着巴掌，当然什么也抓不住。就是把手握起来，但是不握紧，样子象抓，还是抓不住东西。我们有些同志，也抓主要工作，但是抓而不紧，所以工作还是不能做好。不抓不行，抓而不紧也不行。<br/>&#13;
			――《党委会的工作方法》（一九四九年三月十三日），《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一四四三页<br/>&#13;
			"Grasp firmly." That is to say, the Party committee must not merely &#13;
			"grasp", but must "grasp firmly", its main tasks. One can get a grip &#13;
			on something only when it is grasped firmly, without the slightest &#13;
			slackening. Not to grasp firmly is not to grasp at all. Naturally, &#13;
			one cannot get a grip on something with an open hand. When the hand &#13;
			is clenched as if grasping something but is not clenched tightly, &#13;
			there is still no grip. Some of our comrades do grasp the main &#13;
			tasks, but their grasp is not firm and so they cannot make a success &#13;
			of their work. It will not do to have no grasp at all, nor will it &#13;
			do if the grasp is not firm.<br/>&#13;
			D Ibid.<br/>&#13;
			<br/>&#13;
			胸中有“数”。这是说，对情况和问题一定要注意到它们的数量方面，要有基本的数量的分析。任何质量都表现为一定的数量，没有数量也就没有质量。我们有许多同志至今不懂得注意事物的数量方面，不懂得注意基本的统计、主要的百分比，不懂得注意决定事物质量的数量界限，一切都是胸中无“数”，结果就不能不犯错误。<br/>&#13;
			――《党委会的工作方法》（一九四九年三月十三日），《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一四四三页<br/>&#13;
			"Have a head for figures." That is to say, we must attend to the &#13;
			quantitative aspect of a situation or problem and make a basic &#13;
			quantitative analysis. Every quality manifests itself in a certain &#13;
			quantity, and without quantity there can be no quality. To this day &#13;
			many of our comrades still do not understand that they must attend &#13;
			to the quantitative aspect of things - the basic statistics, the &#13;
			main percentages and the quantitative limits that determine the &#13;
			qualities of things. They have no "figures" in their heads and as a &#13;
			result cannot help making mistakes.<br/>&#13;
			D Ibid., pp. 379-80.<br/>&#13;
			<br/>&#13;
			“安民告示”。开会要事先通知，象出安民告示一样，让大家知道讨论什么问题，解决什么问题，并且早作准备。有些地方开干部会，事前不准备好报告和决议草案，等开会的人到了才临时凑合，好象“兵马已到，粮草未备”，这是不好的。如果没有准备，就不要急于开会。<br/>&#13;
			――《党委会的工作方法》（一九四九年三月十三日），《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一四四四页<br/>&#13;
			"Notice to Reassure the Public." Notice of meetings should be given &#13;
			beforehand; this is like issuing a "Notice to Reassure the Public", &#13;
			so that everybody will know what is going to be discussed and what &#13;
			problems are to be solved and can make timely preparations. In some &#13;
			places, meetings of cadres are called without first preparing &#13;
			reports and draft resolutions, and only when people have arrived for &#13;
			the meeting are makeshifts improvised; this is just like the saying, &#13;
			"Troops and horses have arrived, but food and fodder are not ready", &#13;
			and that is no good. Don't call a meeting in a hurry if the &#13;
			preparations are not completed.<br/>&#13;
			D Ibid., p. 380.<br/>&#13;

			“精兵简政”。讲话、演说、写文章和写决议案，都应当简明扼要。会议也不要开得太长。<br/>&#13;
			――《党委会的工作方法》（一九四九年三月十三日），《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一四四四页<br/>&#13;
			"Fewer and better troops and simpler administration." Talks, &#13;
			speeches, articles and resolutions should all be concise and to the &#13;
			point. Meetings also should not go on too long.<br/>&#13;

			<br/>&#13;
			注意团结那些和自己意见不同的同志一道工作。不论在地方上或部队里，都应该注意这一条。对党外人士也是一样。我们都是从五湖四海汇集拢来的，我们不仅要善于团结和自己意见相同的同志，而且要善于团结和自己意见不同的同志一道工作。<br/>&#13;
			――《党委会的工作方法》（一九四九年三月十三日），《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一四四四页<br/>&#13;
			Pay attention to uniting and working with comrades who differ with &#13;
			you. This should be borne in mind both in the localities and in the &#13;
			army. It also applies to relations with people outside the Party. We &#13;
			have come together from every corner of the country and should be &#13;
			good at uniting in our work not only with comrades who hold the same &#13;
			views as we but also with those who hold different views.<br/>&#13;
			D Ibid. <br/>&#13;
			<br/>&#13;
			力戒骄傲。这对领导者是一个原则问题，也是保持团结的一个重要条件。就是没有犯过大错误，而且工作有了很大成绩的人，也不要骄傲。<br/>&#13;
			――《党委会的工作方法》（一九四九年三月十三日），《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一四四四页<br/>&#13;
			Guard against arrogance. For anyone in a leading position, this is a &#13;
			matter of principle and an important condition for maintaining &#13;
			unity. Even those who have made no serious mistakes and have &#13;
			achieved very great success in their work should not be arrogant.<br/>&#13;
			D Ibid.<br/>&#13;
			<br/>&#13;
			划清两种界限。首先，是革命还是反革命？是延安还是西安？有些人不懂得要划清这种界限。例如，他们反对官僚主义，就把延安说得好似“一无是处”，而没有把延安的官僚主义同西安的官僚主义比较一下，区别一下。这就从根本上犯了错误。其次，在革命的队伍中，要划清正确和错误、成绩和缺点的界限，还要弄清它们中间什么是主要的，什么是次要的。例如，成绩究竟是三分还是七分？说少了不行，说多了也不行。一个人的工作，究竟是三分成绩七分错误，还是七分成绩三分错误，必须有个根本的估计。如果是七分成绩，那末就应该对他的工作基本上加以肯定。把成绩为主说成错误为主，那就完全错了。我们看问题一定不要忘记划清这两种界限：革命和反革命的界限，成绩和缺点的界限。记着这两条界限，事情就好办，否则就会把问题的性质弄混淆了。自然，要把界限划好，必须经过细致的研究和分析。我们对于每一个人和每一件事，都应该采取分析研究的态度。<br/>&#13;
			――《党委会的工作方法》（一九四九年三月十三日），《毛泽东选集）第四卷第一四四四――一四四五页<br/>&#13;
			Draw two lines of distinction. First, between revolution and &#13;
			counter-revolution, between Yen'an and Si'an. [1] Some do not &#13;
			understand that they must draw this line of distinction. For &#13;
			example, when they combat bureaucracy, they speak of Yen'an as though &#13;
			"nothing is right" there and fail to make a comparison and &#13;
			distinguish between the bureaucracy in Yen'an and the bureaucracy in &#13;
			Si'an. This is fundamentally wrong. Secondly, within the &#13;
			revolutionary ranks, it is necessary to make a clear distinction &#13;
			between right and wrong, between achievements and shortcomings and &#13;
			to make clear which of the two is primary and which secondary. For &#13;
			instance, do the achievements amount to 30 per cent or to 70 per &#13;
			cent of the whole? It will not do either to understate or to &#13;
			overstate. We must have a fundamental evaluation of a person's work &#13;
			and establish whether his achievements amount to 30 per cent and his &#13;
			mistakes to 70 per cent, or vice versa. If his achievements amount &#13;
			to 70 per cent of the whole, then his work should in the main be &#13;
			approved. It would be entirely wrong to describe work in which the &#13;
			achievements are primary as work in which the mistakes are primary. &#13;
			In our approach to problems we must not forget to draw these two &#13;
			lines of distinction, between revolution and counter-revolution and &#13;
			between achievements and shortcomings. We shall be able to handle &#13;
			things well if we bear these two distinctions in mind; otherwise we &#13;
			shall confuse the nature of the problems. To draw these distinctions &#13;
			well, careful study and analysis are of course necessary. Our &#13;
			attitude towards every person and every matter should be one of &#13;
			analysis and study.<br/>&#13;

			在组织上，厉行集中指导下的民主生活。其路线是：<br/>&#13;

			3 党的各级机关解决问题，不要太随便。一成决议，就须坚决执行。<br/>&#13;
			4 上级机关的决议，凡属重要一点的，必须迅速地传达到下级机关和党员群众中去。……<br/>&#13;
			5 党的下级机关和党员群众对于上级机关的指示，要经过详尽的讨论，以求彻底地了解指示的意义，并决定对它的执行方法。<br/>&#13;

			In the sphere of organization, ensure democracy under centralized &#13;
			guidance. It should be done on the following lines:<br/>&#13;
			(1) The leading bodies of the Party must give a correct line of &#13;
			guidance and find solutions when problems arise, in order to &#13;
			establish themselves as centres of leadership.<br/>&#13;
			(2) The higher bodies must be familiar with the situation in the &#13;
			lower bodies and with the life of the masses so as to have an &#13;
			objective basis for correct guidance.<br/>&#13;
			(3) No Party organization at any level should make casual decisions &#13;
			in solving problems. Once a decision is reached, it must be firmly &#13;
			carried out.<br/>&#13;
			(4) All decisions of any importance made by the Party's higher &#13;
			bodies must be promptly transmitted to the lower bodies and the &#13;
			Party rank and file....<br/>&#13;
			(5) The lower bodies of the Party and the Party rank and file must &#13;
			discuss the higher bodies' directives in detail in order to &#13;
			understand their meaning thoroughly and decide on the methods of &#13;
			carrying them out.<br/>&#13;
