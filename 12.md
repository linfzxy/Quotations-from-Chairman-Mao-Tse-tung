			那时（指一九二四――一九二七年第一次国内革命战争时期――编者）军队设立了党代表和政治部，这种制度是中国历史上没有的，靠了这种制度使军队一新其面目。一九二七年以后的红军以至今日的八路军，是继承了这种制度而加以发展的。 &#13;

			八路军的政治工作的基本原则有三个，即：第一、官兵一致的原则，这就是在军队中肃清封建主义，废除打骂制度，建立自觉纪律，实行同甘共苦的生活，因此全军是团结一致的。第二、军民一致的原则，这就是秋毫无犯的民众纪律，宣传、组织和武装民众，减轻民众的经济负担，打击危害军民的汉奸卖国贼，因此军民团结一致，到处得到人民的欢迎。第三、瓦解敌军和宽待俘虏的原则。我们的胜利不但是依靠我军的作战，而且依靠敌军的瓦解。<br/>&#13;
			――《和英国记者贝特兰的谈话》（一九三七年十月二十五日），《毛泽东选集》第二卷第三六九页<br/>&#13;
			The political work of the Eighth Route Army is guided by three basic &#13;
			principles. First, the principle of unity between officers and men, &#13;
			which means eradicating feudal practices in the army, prohibiting &#13;
			beating and abuse, building up a conscious discipline, and sharing &#13;
			weal and woe - as a result of which the entire army is closely &#13;
			united. Second, the principle of unity between the army and the &#13;
			people, which means maintaining a discipline that forbids the &#13;
			slightest violation of the people's interests, conducting propaganda &#13;
			among the masses, organizing and arming them, lightening their &#13;
			economic burdens and suppressing the traitors and collaborators who &#13;
			do harm to the army and the people - as a result of which the army &#13;
			is closely united with the people and welcomed everywhere. Third, &#13;
			the principle of disintegrating the enemy troops and giving lenient &#13;
			treatment to prisoners of war. Our victory depends not only upon our &#13;
			military operations but also upon the disintegration of the enemy &#13;
			troops.<br/>&#13;

			我们的军队必须在军民关系上、军政关系上、军党关系上、官兵关系上、军事工作和政治工作关系上、干部相互关系上，遵守正确的原则，决不可犯军阀主义的毛病。官长必须爱护士兵，不能漠不关心，不能采取肉刑；军队必须爱护人民，不能损害人民利益；军队必须尊重政府，尊重党，不能闹独立性。<br/>&#13;
			――《组织起来》（一九四三年十一月二十九日），《毛泽东选集》第三卷第九三七页<br/>&#13;
			Our troops must observe the correct principles that govern relations &#13;
			between the army and the people, between the army and the &#13;
			government, between the army and the Party, between officers and &#13;
			men, and between military work and political work, and relations &#13;
			among the cadres, and must never commit the errors of warlordism. &#13;
			Officers must cherish their men and must not be indifferent to their &#13;
			well-being or resort to corporal punishment; the army must cherish &#13;
			the people and never encroach upon their interests; the army must &#13;
			respect the government and the Party and never "assert &#13;
			independence".<br/>&#13;

			对敌军、伪军、反共军的俘虏，除为群众所痛恶、非杀不可而又经过上级批准的人以外，应一律采取释放的政策。其中被迫参加、多少带有革命性的分子，应大批地争取为我军服务，其他则一律释放；如其再来，则再捉再放；不加侮辱，不搜财物，不要自首，一律以诚恳和气的态度对待之。不论他们如何反动，均取这种政策。这对于孤立反动营垒，是非常有效的。<br/>&#13;
			――《论政策》（一九四零年十二月二十五日），《毛泽东选集》第二卷第七六四――七六五页<br/>&#13;
			Our policy towards prisoners captured from the Japanese, puppet or &#13;
			anti-Communist troops is to set them all free, except for those who &#13;
			have incurred the bitter hatred of the masses and must receive &#13;
			capital punishment and whose death sentence has been approved by the &#13;
			higher authorities. Among the prisoners, those who were coerced into &#13;
			joining the reactionary forces but who are more or less inclined &#13;
			towards the revolution should be won over in large numbers to work &#13;
			for our army. The rest should be released and, if they fight us and &#13;
			are captured again, should again be set free. We should not insult &#13;
			them, take away their personal effects or try to exact recantations from them, but without exception should treat them sincerely &#13;
			and kindly. This should be our policy, however reactionary they may &#13;
			be. It is a very effective way of isolating the camp of reaction.<br/>&#13;

			在知识分子和青年学生中间，最近一个时期，思想政治工作减弱了，出现了一些偏向。在一些人的眼中，好象什么政治，什么祖国的前途，人类的理想，都没有关心的必要。好象马克思主义行时了一阵，现在就不那么行时了。针对着这种情况，现在需要加强思想政治工作。不论是知识分子，还是青年学生，都应该努力学习。除了学习专业之外，在思想上要有所进步，政治上也要有所进步，这就需要学习马克思主义，学习时事政治。没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。……思想政治工作，各个部门都要负责任。共产党应该管，青年团应该管，政府主管部门应该管，学校的校长教师更应该管。<br/>&#13;

			Recently there has been a falling off in ideological and political &#13;

			political work. Both students and intellectuals should study hard. &#13;
			In addition to the study of their specialized subjects, they must &#13;
			make progress both ideologically and politically, which means that &#13;
			they should study Marxism, current events and politics. Not to have &#13;
