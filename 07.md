			全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。<br/>&#13;
			――《支持刚果（利）人民反对美国侵略的声明》（一九六四年十一月二十八日），《全世界人民团结起来打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗》人民出版社版第一四页<br/>&#13;
			People of the world, unite and defeat the U.S. aggressors and all &#13;
			their running dogs! People of the world, be courageous, dare to &#13;
			fight, defy difficulties and advance wave upon wave. Then the whole &#13;
			world will belong to the people. Monsters of all kinds shall be &#13;
			destroyed.<br/>&#13;

			中国共产党依据马克思列宁主义的科学，清醒地估计了国际和国内的形势，知道一切内外反动派的进攻，不但是必须打败的，而且是能够打败的。当着天空中出现乌云的时候，我们就指出：这不过是暂时的现象，黑暗即将过去，曙光即在前头。<br/>&#13;
			――《目前形势和我们的任务》（一九四七年十二月二十五日），《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一二四五――一二四六页<br/>&#13;
			The Communist Party of China, having made a clear-headed appraisal &#13;
			of the international and domestic situation on the basis of the &#13;
			science of Marxism-Leninism, recognized that all attacks by the &#13;
			reactionaries at home and abroad had to be defeated and could be &#13;
			defeated. When dark clouds appeared in the sky, we pointed out that &#13;
			they were only temporary, that the darkness would soon pass and the &#13;
			sun break through.<br/>&#13;

			在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的，而有些革命的人们也往往在一个期间内被这种外强中干的现象所迷惑，看不出敌人快要消灭，自己快要胜利的实质。<br/>&#13;
			――《第二次世界大战的转折点》（一九四二年十月十二日），《毛泽东选集》第三卷第八八五页<br/>&#13;
			Historically, all reactionary forces on the verge of extinction &#13;
			invariably conduct a last desperate struggle against the &#13;
			revolutionary forces, and some revolutionaries are apt to be deluded &#13;
			for a time by this phenomenon of outward strength but inner weakness &#13;
			failing to grasp the essential fact that the enemy is nearing &#13;
			extinction while they themselves are approaching victory.<br/>&#13;

			Works, Vol. III, p. 103.<br/>&#13;
			<br/>&#13;
			如果他们要打，就把他们彻底消灭。事情就是这样，他来进攻，我们把他消灭了，他就舒服了。消灭一点，舒服一点；消灭得多，舒服得多；彻底消灭，彻底舒服。中国的问题是复杂的，我们的脑子也要复杂一点。人家打来了，我们就打，打是为了争取和平。<br/>&#13;
			――《关于重庆谈判》（一九四五年十月十七日），《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一一五八页<br/>&#13;
			If they [the Kuomintang] fight, we will wipe them out completely. &#13;
			This is the way things are: if they attack and we wipe them out, &#13;
			they will have that satisfaction; wipe out some, some satisfaction; &#13;
			wipe out more, more satisfaction; wipe out the whole lot, complete &#13;
			satisfaction. China's problems are complicated, and our brains must &#13;
			also be a little complicated. If they start fighting, we fight back, &#13;
			fight to win peace.<br/>&#13;

			有来犯者，只要好打，我党必定站在自卫立场上坚决彻底干净全部消灭之（不要轻易打，打则必胜），绝对不要被反动派的其势汹汹所吓倒。<br/>&#13;
			――《中共中央关于同国民党进行和平谈判的通知》（一九四五年八月二十六日），《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一一五三页<br/>&#13;
			If anyone attacks us and if the conditions are favourable for &#13;
			battle, we will certainly act in self-defence to wipe him out &#13;
			resolutely, thoroughly, wholly and completely (we do not strike &#13;
			rashly, but when we do strike, we must win). We must never be cowed &#13;
			by the bluster of reactionaries.<br/>&#13;

			就我们自己的愿望说，我们连一天也不愿意打。但是如果形势迫使我们不得不打的话，我们是能够一直打到底的。<br/>&#13;
			――《和美国记者安那・路易斯・斯特朗的谈话》（一九四六年八月），《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一一八九――一一九零页<br/>&#13;
			As far as our own desire is concerned, we don't want to fight even &#13;
			for a single day. But if circumstances force us to fight, we can &#13;
			fight to the finish.<br/>&#13;
			D "Talk with the American Correspondent Anna Louise Strong" (August &#13;
			1946), Selected Works, Vol. IV, p. 97.<br/>&#13;
			<br/>&#13;
			我们是要和平的，但是，只要美帝国主义一天不放弃它那种横蛮无理的要求和扩大侵略的阴谋，中国人民的决心就是只有同朝鲜人民一起，一直战斗下去。这不是因为我们好战，我们愿意立即停战，剩下的问题待将来去解决。但美帝国主义不愿意这样做，那么好罢，就打下去，美帝国主义愿意打多少年，我们也就准备跟他打多少年，一直打到美帝国主义愿意罢手的时候为止，一直打到中朝人民完全胜利的时候为止。<br/>&#13;
			――《在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第四次会议上的讲话》（一九五三年二月七日），一九五三年二月八日《人民日报》<br/>&#13;
			We are for peace. But so long as U.S. imperialism refuses to give up &#13;
			its arrogant and unreasonable demands and its scheme to extend &#13;
			aggression, the only course for the Chinese people is to remain &#13;
			determined to go on fighting side by side with the Korean people. &#13;
			Not that we are warlike. We are willing to stop the war at once and &#13;
			leave the remaining questions for later settlement. But U.S. &#13;
			imperialism is not willing to do so. All right then, let the &#13;
			fighting go on. However many years U.S. imperialism wants to fight, &#13;
			we are ready to fight right up to the moment when it is willing to &#13;
			stop, right up to the moment of complete victory for the Chinese and &#13;
			Korean peoples.<br/>&#13;

			我们应当在自己内部肃清一切软弱无能的思想。一切过高地估计敌人力量和过低地估计人民力量的观点，都是错误的。<br/>&#13;
			――《目前形势和我们的任务》（一九四七年十二月二十五日），《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一二五九页<br/>&#13;
			We should rid our ranks of all impotent thinking. All views that &#13;
			overestimate the strength of the enemy and underestimate the &#13;
			strength of the people are wrong.<br/>&#13;

			被压迫人民和被压迫民族，决不能把自己的解放寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的“明智”上面，而只有通过加强团结、坚持斗争，才能取得胜利。<br/>&#13;
			――《反对美国――吴庭艳集团侵略和屠杀越南南方人民的声明》（一九六三年八月二十九日），《全世界人民团结起来打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗》人民出版社版第六页<br/>&#13;
			The oppressed peoples and nations must not pin their hopes for &#13;
			liberation on the "sensibleness" of imperialism and its lackeys. &#13;
			They will only triumph by strengthening their unity and persevering &#13;
			in their struggle.<br/>&#13;

			全国性的内战不论那一天爆发，我们都要准备好。早一点，明天早上就打吧，我们也在准备着。这是第一条。现在的国际国内形势，有可能把内战暂时限制在局部范围，内战可能暂是若干地方性的战争。这是第二条。第一条我们准备着，第二条是早已如此。总而言之，我们要有准备。有了准备，就能恰当地应付各种复杂的局面。<br/>&#13;
			――《抗日战争胜利后的时局和我们的方针》（一九四五年八月十三日），《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一――三页<br/>&#13;
			No matter when this country-wide civil war breaks out, we must be &#13;
			well prepared. If it comes early, say, tomorrow morning, we should &#13;
			also be prepared. That is point one. In the present international &#13;
			and domestic situation it is possible that for a time the civil war &#13;
			may be kept restricted in scale and localized. That is point two. &#13;
			Point one is what we should prepare for, point two is what has &#13;
			existed for a long time. In short, we must be prepared. Being &#13;
			prepared, we shall be able to deal properly with all kinds of &#13;
			complicated situations.<br/>&#13;
