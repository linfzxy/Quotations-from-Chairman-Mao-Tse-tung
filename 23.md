			一切实际工作者必须向下作调查。对于只懂得理论不懂得实际情况的人，这种调查工作尤有必要，否则他们就不能将理论和实际相联系。“没有调查就没有发言权”，这句话，虽然曾经被人讥为“狭隘经验论”的，我却至今不悔；不但不悔，我仍然坚持没有调查是不可能有发言权的。有许多人，“下车伊始”，就哇喇哇喇地发议论，提意见，这也批评，那也指责，其实这种人十个有十个要失败。因为这种议论或批评，没有经过周密调查，不过是无知妄说。我们党吃所谓“钦差大臣”的亏，是不可胜数的。而这种“钦差大臣”则是满天飞，几乎到处都有。斯大林的话说得对：“理论若不和革命实践联系起来，就会变成无对象的理论。”当然又是他的话对：“实践若不以革命理论为指南，就会变成盲目的实践。”除了盲目的、无前途的、无远见的实际家，是不能叫做“狭隘经验论”的。<br/>&#13;

			Everyone engaged in practical work must investigate conditions at &#13;
			the lower levels. Such investigation is especially necessary for &#13;
			those who know theory but do not know the actual conditions, for &#13;
			otherwise they will not be able to link theory with practice. &#13;
			Although my assertion, "No investigation no right to speak", has &#13;
			been ridiculed as "narrow empiricism", to this day I do not regret &#13;
			having made it; far from regretting it, I still insist that without &#13;
			investigation there cannot possibly be any right to speak. There are &#13;
			many people who "the moment they alight from the official carriage" &#13;
			make a hullabaloo, spout opinions, criticize this and condemn that; &#13;
			but, in fact, ten out of ten of them will meet with failure. For &#13;
			such views or criticisms, which are not based on thorough &#13;
			investigation, are nothing but ignorant twaddle. Countless times our &#13;
			Party suffered at the hands of these "imperial envoys", who rushed &#13;
			here, there and everywhere. Stalin rightly says that "theory becomes &#13;
			purposeless if it is not connected with revolutionary practice". And &#13;
			he rightly adds that "practice gropes in the dark if its path is not &#13;
			illumined by revolutionary theory". Nobody should be labelled a &#13;
			"narrow empiricist" except the "practical man" who gropes in the &#13;
			dark and lacks perspective and foresight.<br/>&#13;

			这种态度，就是实事求是的态度。“实事”就是客观存在着的一切事物，“是”就是客观事物的内部联系，即规律性，“求”就是我们去研究。我们要从国内外、省内外、县内外、区内外的实际情况出发，从其中引出其固有的而不是臆造的规律性，即找出周围事变的内部联系，作为我们行动的向导。而要这样做，就须不凭主观想像，不凭一时的热情，不凭死的书本，而凭客观存在的事实，详细地占有材料，在马克思列宁主义一般原理的指导下，从这些材料中引出正确的结论。<br/>&#13;
			――《改造我们的学习》（一九四一年五月）《毛泽东选集》第三卷第八零一页<br/>&#13;
			To take such an attitude is to seek truth from facts. "Facts" are &#13;
			all the things that exist objectively, "truth" means their internal &#13;
			relations, that is, the laws governing them, and "to seek" means to &#13;
			study. We should proceed from the actual conditions inside and &#13;
			outside the country, the province, county or district, and derive &#13;
			from them, as our guide to action, laws which are inherent in them &#13;
			and not imaginary, that is, we should find the internal relations of &#13;
			the events occurring around us. And in order to do that we must rely &#13;
			not on subjective imagination, not on momentary enthusiasm, not on &#13;
			lifeless books, but on facts that exist objectively; we must &#13;
			appropriate the material in detail and, guided by the general &#13;
			principles of Marxism-Leninism, draw correct conclusions from it.<br/>&#13;

			“闭塞眼睛捉麻雀”，“瞎子摸鱼”，粗枝大叶，夸夸其谈，满足于一知半解，这种极坏的作风，这种完全违反马克思列宁主义基本精神的作风，还在我党许多同志中继续存在着。马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林教导我们认真地研究情况，从客观的真实的情况出发，而不是从主观的愿望出发；我们的许多同志却直接违反这一真理。<br/>&#13;
			――《改造我们的学习》（一九四一年五月），《毛泽东选集》第三卷第七九七页<br/>&#13;
			To behave like "a blindfolded man catching sparrows", or "a blind &#13;
			man groping for fish", to be crude and careless, to indulge in &#13;
			verbiage, to rest content with a smattering of knowledge - such is &#13;
			the extremely bad style of work that still exists among many &#13;
			comrades in our Party, a style utterly opposed to the fundamental &#13;
			spirit of Marxism-Leninism. Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin have &#13;
			taught us that it is necessary to study conditions conscientiously &#13;
			and to proceed from objective reality and not from subjective &#13;
			wishes; but many of our comrades act in direct violation of this &#13;
			truth.<br/>&#13;
			D Ibid. p. 18.<br/>&#13;

			你对于那个问题不能解决么？那末，你就去调查那个问题的现状和它的历史吧！你完完全全调查明白了，你对那个问题就有解决的办法了。一切结论产生于调查情况的末尾，而不是在它的先头。只有蠢人，才是他一个人，或者邀集一堆人，不作调查，而只是冥思苦索地“想办法”，“打主意”。须知这是一定不能想出什么好办法，打出什么好主意的。<br/>&#13;
			――《反对本本主义》（一九三零年五月），人民出版社版第二页<br/>&#13;
			You can't solve a problem? Well, get down and investigate the &#13;
			present facts and its past history! When you have investigated the &#13;
			problem thoroughly, you will know how to solve it. Conclusions &#13;
			invariably come after investigation, and not before. Only a &#13;
			blockhead cudgels his brains on his own, or together with a group, &#13;
			to "find a solution" or "evolve an idea" without making any &#13;
			investigation. It must be stressed that this cannot possibly lead to &#13;
			any effective solution or any good idea.<br/>&#13;
			D "Oppose Book Worship" (May 1930), 1st pocket ed., p. 2.<br/>&#13;
			<br/>&#13;
			调查就象“十月怀胎”，解决问题就象“一朝分娩”。调查就是解决问题。<br/>&#13;
			――《反对本本主义》（一九三零年五月），人民出版社版第三页<br/>&#13;
			Investigation may be likened to the long months of pregnancy, and &#13;
			solving a problem to the day of birth. To investigate a problem is, &#13;
			indeed, to solve it.<br/>&#13;

			应用马克思列宁主义的理论和方法，对周围环境作系统的周密的调查和研究。不是单凭热情去工作，而是如同斯大林所说的那样：把革命气概和实际精神结合起来。<br/>&#13;
			――《改造我们的学习》（一九四一年五月），《毛泽东选集》第三卷第八零一页<br/>&#13;
			[With the Marxist-Leninist attitude,] a person applies the theory &#13;
			and method of Marxism-Leninism to the systematic and thorough &#13;
			investigation and study of the environment. He does not work by &#13;
			enthusiasm alone but, as Stalin says, combines revolutionary sweep &#13;
			with practicalness.<br/>&#13;

			要了解情况，唯一的方法是向社会作调查，调查社会各阶级的生动情况。对于担负指导工作的人来说，有计划地抓住几个城市、几个乡村，用马克思主义的基本观点，即阶级分析的方法，作几次周密的调查，乃是了解情况的最基本的方法。<br/>&#13;
			――《“农村调查”的序言和跋》（一九四一年三月、四月），《毛泽东选集》第三卷第七八九页<br/>&#13;
			The only way to know conditions is to make social investigations, to &#13;
			investigate the conditions of each social class in real life. For &#13;
			those charged with directing work, the basic method for knowing &#13;
			conditions is to concentrate on a few cities and villages according &#13;
			to a plan and, using the fundamental viewpoint of Marxism, i.e., the &#13;
			method of class analysis, make a number of thorough investigations.<br/>&#13;

			开调查会每次人不必多，三五个七八个人即够。必须给予时间，必须有调查纲目，还必须自己口问手写，并同到会人展开讨论。因此，没有满腔的热忱，没有眼睛向下的决心，没有求知的渴望，没有放下臭架子、甘当小学生的精神，是一定不能做，也一定做不好的。<br/>&#13;
			――《“农村调查”的序言和跋》（一九四一年三月、四月），《毛泽东选集》第三卷第七九零页<br/>&#13;
			A fact-finding meeting need not be large; from three to five or &#13;
			seven or eight people are enough. Ample time must be allowed and an &#13;
			outline for the investigation must be prepared; furthermore, one &#13;
			must personally ask questions, take notes and have discussions with &#13;
			those at the meeting. Therefore one certainly cannot make an &#13;
			investigation, or do it well, without zeal, a determination to &#13;
			direct one's eyes downward and a thirst for knowledge, and without &#13;
			shedding the ugly mantle of pretentiousness and becoming a willing &#13;
			pupil.<br/>&#13;
			D Ibid., p. 12.<br/>&#13;
			<br/>&#13;
			指挥员的正确的部署来源于正确的决心，正确的决心来源于正确的判断，正确的判断来源于周到的和必要的侦察，和对于各种侦察材料的联贯起来的思索。指挥员使用一切可能的和必要的侦察手段，将侦察得来的敌方情况的各种材料加以去粗取精、去伪存真、由此及彼、由表及里的思索，然后将自己方面的情况加上去，研究双方的对比和相互的关系，因而构成判断，定下决心，作出计划，――这是军事家在作出每一个战略、战役或战斗的计划之前的一个整个的认识情况的过程。<br/>&#13;
			――《中国革命战争的战略问题》（一九三六年十二月），《毛泽东选集》第一卷第一七三页<br/>&#13;
			A commander's correct dispositions stem from his correct decisions, &#13;
			his correct decisions stem from his correct judgements, and his &#13;
			correct judgements stem from a thorough and necessary reconnaissance &#13;
			and from pondering on and piecing together the data of various kinds &#13;
			gathered through reconnaissance. He applies all possible and &#13;
			necessary methods of reconnaissance, and ponders on the information &#13;
			gathered about the enemy's situation, discarding the dross and &#13;
			selecting the essential, eliminating the false and retaining the &#13;
			true, proceeding from the one to the other and from the outside to &#13;
			the inside; then, he takes the conditions on his own side into &#13;
			account, and makes a study of both sides and their interrelations, &#13;
			thereby forming his judgements, making up his mind and working out &#13;
			his plans. Such is the complete process of knowing a situation which &#13;
			a military man goes through before he formulates a strategic plan, a &#13;
			campaign plan or a battle plan.<br/>&#13;
