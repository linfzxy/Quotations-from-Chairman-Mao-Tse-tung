			要使全体干部和全体人民经常想到我国是一个社会主义的大国，但又是一个经济落后的穷国，这是一个很大的矛盾。要使我国富强起来，需要几十年艰苦奋斗的时间，其中包括执行厉行节约、反对浪费这样一个勤俭建国的方针。<br/>&#13;

			We must see to it that all our cadres and all our people constantly &#13;
			bear in mind that ours is a big socialist country but an &#13;
			economically backward and poor one, and that this is a very great &#13;
			contradiction. To make China rich and strong needs several decades &#13;
			of intense effort, which will include, among other things, the &#13;
			effort to practise strict economy and combat waste, i.e., the policy &#13;
			of building up our country through diligence and frugality.<br/>&#13;

			勤俭办工厂，勤俭办商店，勤俭办一切国营事业和合作事业，勤俭办一切其他事业，什么事情都应当执行勤俭的原则。这就是节约的原则，节约是社会主义经济的基本原则之一。中国是一个大国，但是现在还很穷，要使中国富起来，需要几十年时间，几十年以后也需要执行勤俭的原则，但是特别要提倡勤俭，特别要注意节约的，是在目前这几十年内，是在目前这几个五年计划的时期内。<br/>&#13;

			Diligence and frugality should be practised in running factories and &#13;
			shops and all state-owned, co-operative and other enterprises. The &#13;
			principle of diligence and frugality should be observed in &#13;
			everything. This principle of economy is one of the basic principles &#13;
			of socialist economics. China is a big country, but she is still &#13;
			very poor. It will take several decades to make China prosperous. &#13;
			Even then we will still have to observe the principle of diligence &#13;
			and frugality. But it is in the coming few decades, during the &#13;
			present series of five-year plans, that we must particularly &#13;
			advocate diligence and frugality, that we must pay special attention &#13;
			to economy.<br/>&#13;

			任何地方必须十分爱惜人力物力，决不可只顾一时，滥用浪费。任何地方必须从开始工作的那一年起，就计算到将来的很多年，计算到长期坚持战争，计算到反攻，计算到赶走敌人之后的建设。一面决不滥用浪费，一面努力发展生产。过去有些地方缺少长期打算，既未注意节省人力物力，又未注意发展生产，吃了大亏。得了这个教训，现在必须引起注意。<br/>&#13;

			Wherever we happen to be, we must treasure our manpower and material &#13;
			resources, and must not take a short view and indulge in &#13;
			wastefulness and extravagance. Wherever we are, from the very first &#13;
			year of our work we must bear in mind the many years to come, the &#13;
			protracted war that must be maintained, the counter-offensive, and &#13;
			the work of reconstruction after the enemy's expulsion. On the one &#13;
			hand, never be wasteful or extravagant; on the other, actively &#13;
			expand production. Previously, in some places people suffered a &#13;
			great deal because they did not take the long view and neglected &#13;
			economy in manpower and material resources and the expansion of &#13;
			production. The lesson is there and attention must be called to it.<br/>&#13;

			为了迅速地恢复和发展农业生产和市镇上的工业生产，在消灭封建制度的斗争中，必须注意尽一切努力最大限度地保存一切可用的生产资料和生活资料，采取办法坚决地反对任何人对于生产资料和生活资料的破坏和浪费，反对大吃大喝，注意节约。<br/>&#13;

			In order to speed up this restoration and development [of &#13;

			we must do our utmost, in the course of our struggle for the &#13;
			abolition of the feudal system, to preserve all useful means of &#13;
			production and of livelihood, take resolute measures against &#13;
			anyone's destroying or wasting them, oppose extravagant eating and &#13;

			财政的支出，应该根据节省的方针。应该使一切政府工作人员明白，贪污和浪费是极大的犯罪。反对贪污和浪费的斗争，过去有了些成绩，以后还应用力。节省每一个铜板为着战争和革命事业，为着我们的经济建设，是我们的会计制度的原则。<br/>&#13;
			――《我们的经济政策》（一九三四年一月二十三日），《毛泽东选集》第一卷第一二九页<br/>&#13;
			Thrift should be the guiding principle in our government &#13;
			expenditure. It should be made clear to all government workers that &#13;
			corruption and waste are very great crimes. Our campaigns against &#13;
			corruption and waste have already achieved some results, but further &#13;
			efforts are required. Our system of accounting must be guided by the &#13;
			principle of saving every copper for the war effort, for the &#13;
			revolutionary cause and for our economic construction.<br/>&#13;

			在我们的许多工作人员中间，现在滋长着一种不愿意和群众同甘苦，喜欢计较个人名利的危险倾向，这是很不好的。我们在增产节约运动中要求精简机关，下放干部，使相当大的一批干部回到生产中去，就是克服这种危险倾向的一个方法。<br/>&#13;
			――《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》（一九五七年二月二十七日），人民出版社版第三六页<br/>&#13;
			A dangerous tendency has shown itself of late among many of our &#13;
			personnel - an unwillingness to share the joys and hardships of the &#13;
			masses, a concern for personal fame and gain. This is very bad. One &#13;
			way of overcoming it is to simplify our organizations in the course &#13;
			of our campaign to increase production and practise economy, and to &#13;
			transfer cadres to lower levels so that a considerable number will &#13;
			return to productive work.<br/>&#13;

			军队生产自给，不但改善了生活，减轻了人民负担，并因而能够扩大军队，而且立即带来了许多副产物。这些副产物就是：（一）改善官兵关系。官兵一道生产劳动，亲如兄弟了。（二）增强劳动观念。……生产自给以来，劳动观念加强了，二流子的习气被改造了。（三）增强纪律性。在生产中执行劳动纪律，不但不会减弱战斗纪律和军人生活纪律，反而会增强它们。（四）改善军民关系。部队有了家务，侵害老百姓财物的事就少了，或者完全没有了。在生产中，军民变工互助，更增强他们之间的友好关系。（五）军队埋怨政府的事也会少了，军政关系也好了。（六）促进人民的大生产运动。军队生产了，机关生产更显得必要，更有劲了；全体人民的普遍增产运动，当然也更显得必要，更有劲了。<br/>&#13;
			――《论军队生产自给，兼论整风和生产两大运动的重要性》（一九四五年四月二十七日），《毛泽东选集》第三卷第一一零七页<br/>&#13;
			Production by the army for its own support has not only improved the &#13;
			army's living conditions and lightened the burden on the people, &#13;
			thereby making it possible further to expand the army. In addition, &#13;
			it has had many immediate side-effects. They are as follows:<br/>&#13;
			(1) Improved relations between officers and men. Officers and men &#13;
			work together in production and become like brothers.<br/>&#13;
			(2) Better attitude to labour.... since the army began to produce &#13;
			for its own support, the attitude to labour has improved and loafer &#13;
			ways have been overcome.<br/>&#13;
			(3) Strengthened discipline. Far from weakening discipline in battle &#13;
			and in army life, labour discipline in production actually &#13;
			strengthens it.<br/>&#13;
			(4) Improved relations between the army and the people. Once an &#13;
			armed force begins to "keep house" for itself, encroachments upon &#13;
			the property of the people seldom or never occur. As the army and &#13;
			the people exchange labour and help each other in production, the &#13;
			friendship between them is strengthened.<br/>&#13;
			(5) Less grumbling in the army about the government and improved &#13;
			relations between the two.<br/>&#13;
			(6) An impetus to the great production campaign of the people. Once &#13;
			the army engages in production, the need for government and other &#13;
			organizations to do likewise becomes more obvious, and they do so &#13;
			more energetically; also, the need for a universal campaign of the &#13;
			whole people to increase production naturally becomes more obvious, &#13;
			and this too is carried on more energetically.<br/>&#13;
			D "On Production by the Army for Its Own Support and on the &#13;
			Importance of the Great Movements for Rectification and for &#13;
			Production" (April 27, 1945), Selected Works, Vol. III, pp. 327-28.*<br/>&#13;

			有人说：部队生产，就不能作战和训练了；机关生产，就不能工作了。这种说法是不对的。最近几年，我们边区部队从事大量的生产，衣食丰足，同时又进行练兵，又有政治和文化学习，这些都比从前有更大的成绩，军队内部的团结和军民之间的团结，也比从前更好了。在前方，去年一年进行了大规模的生产运动，可是去年一年作战方面有很大的成绩，并且普遍地开始了练兵运动。机关因为生产，工作人员生活改善了，工作更安心、更有效率，边区和前方都是这样。<br/>&#13;
			――《必须学会做经济工作》（一九四五年一月十日），《毛泽东选集》第三卷第一零一八页<br/>&#13;
			Some people say that if the army units go in for production, they &#13;
			will be unable to train or fight and that if the government and &#13;
			other organizations do so, they will be unable to do their own work. &#13;
			This is a false argument. In recent years our army units in the &#13;
			Border Region have undertaken production on a big scale to provide &#13;
			themselves with ample food and clothing and have simultaneously done &#13;
			their training and conducted their political studies and literacy &#13;
			and other courses much more successfully than before, and there is &#13;
			greater unity than ever within the army and between the army and the &#13;
			people. While there was a large-scale production campaign at the &#13;
			front last year, great successes were gained in the fighting and in &#13;
			addition an extensive training campaign was started. And thanks to &#13;
			production, the personnel of the government and other organizations &#13;
			live a better life and work with greater devotion and efficiency; &#13;
			this is the case both in the Border Region and at the front.<br/>&#13;
