			军队须和民众打成一片，使军队在民众眼睛中看成是自己的军队，这个军队便无敌于天下，……<br/>&#13;
			――《论持久战》（一九三八年五月），《毛泽东选集》第二卷第五零一页<br/>&#13;
			The army must become one with the people so that they see it as &#13;
			their own army. Such an army will be invincible....<br/>&#13;
			D "On Protracted War" (May 1938), Selected Works, Vol. II, p. 186.<br/>&#13;
			<br/>&#13;
			应该使每一个同志懂得，只要我们依靠人民，坚决地相信人民群众的创造力是无穷无尽的，因而信任人民，和人民打成一片，那就任何困难也能克服，任何敌人也不能压倒我们，而只会被我们所压倒。<br/>&#13;
			――《论联合政府》（一九四五年四月二十四日），《毛泽东选集》第三卷第一零九七页<br/>&#13;
			Every comrade must be helped to understand that as long as we rely &#13;
			on the people, believe firmly in the inexhaustible creative power of &#13;
			the masses and hence trust and identify ourselves with them, we can &#13;
			surmount any difficulty, and no enemy can crush us while we can &#13;
			crush any enemy.<br/>&#13;
			D "On Coalition Government" (April 24, 1945), Selected Works, Vol. &#13;
			III, p. 316.*<br/>&#13;
			<br/>&#13;
			我们的同志不论到什么地方，都要和群众的关系搞好，要关心群众，帮助他们解决困难。团结广大人民，团结得越多越好。<br/>&#13;
			――《关于重庆谈判》（一九四五年十月十七日），《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一一六一页<br/>&#13;
			Wherever our comrades go, they must build good relations with the &#13;
			masses, be concerned for them and help them overcome their &#13;
			difficulties. We must unite with the masses, the more of the masses &#13;
			we unite with, the better.<br/>&#13;

			Works, Vol. IV, p. 59.<br/>&#13;

			在解放区，一方面，军队应实行拥政爱民的工作，另一方面，民主政府应领导人民实行拥军优抗的工作，更大地改善军民关系。<br/>&#13;
			――《论联合政府》（一九四五年四月二十四日），《毛泽东选集》第三卷第一零九一页<br/>&#13;
			The army in the Liberated Areas must support the government and &#13;
			cherish the people, while the democratic governments must lead the &#13;
			people in the work of supporting the army and giving preferential &#13;
			treatment to the families of soldiers fighting Japan. In this way &#13;
			relations between the army and the people will become still better.<br/>&#13;
			D "On Coalition Government" (April 24, 1945), Selected Works, Vol. &#13;
			III, p. 311.*<br/>&#13;
			<br/>&#13;
			军队中应当从每个指战员的思想上解决问题，使他们彻底认识拥政爱民的重要性。只要军队方面做好了，地方对军队的关系必会跟着改善。<br/>&#13;
			――《一九四六年解放区工作的方针》（一九四五年十二月十五日），《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一一七三页<br/>&#13;
			In the army the task of supporting the government and cherishing the &#13;
			people should be handled through the ideological education of every &#13;
			commander and fighter, so that they all thoroughly understand its &#13;
			importance. As long as the army on its part does this job well, the &#13;
			local government and the people will also improve their relations &#13;
			with the army.<br/>&#13;
			D "Policy for Work in the Liberated Areas for 1946" (December 15, &#13;
			1945), Selected Works, Vol. IV, p. 77.*<br/>&#13;
			<br/>&#13;
			在拥政爱民和拥军优抗的运动中，彻底检查军队方面和党政方面各自在一九四三年的缺点错误，而于一九四四年坚决改正之。以后应于每年正月普遍举行一次，再三再四地宣读拥政爱民公约和拥军优抗公约，再三再四地将各根据地曾经发生的军队欺压党政民和党政民关心军队不足的缺点错误，实行公开的群众性的自我批评（各方面只批评自己，不批评对方），而彻底改正之。<br/>&#13;
			――《开展根据地的减租、生产和拥政爱民运动》（一九四三年十月一日），《毛泽东选集》第三卷第九一六页<br/>&#13;
			In the course of these campaigns[1], the army on its side and the &#13;
			Party and the government on theirs should thoroughly examine the &#13;
			shortcomings and mistakes of 1943, and should resolutely correct &#13;
			them in 1944. From now on, such campaigns should be launched &#13;
			everywhere in the first month of every lunar year, and in the course &#13;
			of them the pledges to "support the government and cherish the &#13;
			people" and "support the army and give preferential treatment to the &#13;
			families of soldiers fighting Japan" should be read out time and &#13;
			again, and there should be repeated self-criticism before the masses &#13;
			of any high-handed behaviour by the troops in the base areas towards &#13;
			the Party or government personnel or towards civilians, or of any &#13;
			lack of concern for the troops shown by the Party or government &#13;
			personnel or the civilians (each side criticizing itself and not the &#13;
			other) in order that these shortcomings and mistakes may be &#13;
			thoroughly corrected.<br/>&#13;
