			为了保证我们的党和国家不改变颜色，我们不仅需要正确的路线和政策，而且需要培养和造就千百万无产阶级革命事业的接班人。<br/>&#13;
			培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的问题从根本上来说，就是老一代无产阶级革命家所开创的马克思列宁主义的革命事业是不是后继有人的问题，就是将来我们党和国家的领导能不能继续掌握在无产阶级革命家手中的问题，就是我们的子孙后代能不能沿着马克思列宁主义的正确道路继续前进的问题，也就是我们能不能胜利地防止赫鲁晓夫修正主义在中国重演的问题。总之，这是关系我们党和国家命运的生死存亡的极其重大的问题。这是无产阶级革命事业的百年大计，千年大计，万年大计。帝国主义的预言家们根据苏联发生的变化，也把“和平演变”的希望，寄托在中国党的第三代或者第四代身上。我们一定要使帝国主义的这种预言彻底破产。我们一定要从上到下地、普遍地、经常不断地注意培养和造就革命事业的接班人。<br/>&#13;
			具备什么条件，才能够充当无产阶级革命事业的接班人呢？<br/>&#13;
			他们必须是真正的马克思列宁主义者，而不是象赫鲁晓夫那样的挂着马克思列宁主义招牌的修正主义者。<br/>&#13;
			他们必须是全心全意为中国和世界的绝大多数人服务的革命者，而不是象赫鲁晓夫那样，在国内为一小撮资产阶级特权阶层的利益服务，在国际为帝国主义和反动派的利益服务。<br/>&#13;
			他们必须是能够团结绝大多数人一道工作的无产阶级政治家。不但要团结和自己意见相同的人，而且要善于团结那些和自己意见不同的人，还要善于团结那些反对过自己并且已被实践证明是犯了错误的人。但是要特别警惕像赫鲁晓夫那样的个人野心家和阴谋家，防止这样的坏人篡夺党和国家的各级领导。<br/>&#13;
			他们必须是党的民主集中制的模范执行者，必须学会“从群众中来，到群众中去”的领导方法，必须养成善于听取群众意见的民主作风。而不能像赫鲁晓夫那样，破坏党的民主集中制，专横跋扈，对同志搞突然袭击，不讲道理，实行个人独裁。<br/>&#13;
			他们必须谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，富于自我批评精神，勇于改正自己工作中的缺点和错误。而绝不能象赫鲁晓夫那样，文过饰非，把一切功劳归于自己，把一切错误归于别人。<br/>&#13;
			无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的。应当在长期的群众斗争中，考察和识别干部，挑选和培养接班人。 &#13;

			In order to guarantee that our Party and country do not change their &#13;
			colour, we must not only have a correct line and correct policies &#13;
			but must train and bring up millions of successors who will carry on &#13;
			the cause of proletarian revolution.<br/>&#13;
			In the final analysis, the question of training successors for the &#13;
			revolutionary cause of the proletariat is one of whether or not &#13;
			there will be people who can carry on the Marxist-Leninist &#13;
			revolutionary cause started by the older generation of proletarian &#13;
			revolutionaries, whether or not the leadership of our Party and &#13;
			state will remain in the hands of proletarian revolutionaries, &#13;
			whether or not our descendants will continue to march along the &#13;
			correct road laid down by Marxism-Leninism, or, in other words, &#13;
			whether or not we can successfully prevent the emergence of &#13;
			Khrushchov's revisionism in China. In short, it is an extremely &#13;
			important question, a matter of life and death for our Party and our &#13;
			country. It is a question of fundamental importance to the &#13;
			proletarian revolutionary cause for a hundred, a thousand, nay ten &#13;
			thousand years. Basing themselves on the changes in the Soviet &#13;
			Union, the imperialist prophets are pinning their hopes of "peaceful &#13;
			evolution" on the third or fourth generation of the Chinese Party. &#13;
			We must shatter these imperialist prophecies. From our highest &#13;
			organizations down to the grass-roots, we must everywhere give &#13;
			constant attention to the training and upbringing of successors to &#13;
			the revolutionary cause.<br/>&#13;
			What are the requirements for worthy successors to the revolutionary &#13;
			cause of the proletariat?<br/>&#13;
			They must be genuine Marxist-Leninists and not revisionists like &#13;
			Khrushchov wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism.<br/>&#13;
			They must be revolutionaries who wholeheartedly serve the &#13;
			overwhelming majority of the people of China and the whole world, &#13;
			and must not be like Khrushchov who serves both the interests of the &#13;
			handful of members of the privileged bourgeois stratum in his own &#13;
			country and those of foreign imperialism and reaction.<br/>&#13;
			They must be proletarian statesmen capable of uniting and working &#13;
			together with the overwhelming majority. Not only must they unite &#13;
			with those who agree with them, they must also be good at uniting &#13;
			with those who disagree and even with those who formerly opposed &#13;
			them and have since been proved wrong in practice. But they must &#13;
			especially watch out for careerists and conspirators like Khrushchov &#13;
			and prevent such bad elements from usurping the leadership of the &#13;
			Party and the state at any level.<br/>&#13;
			They must be models in applying the Party's democratic centralism, &#13;
			must master the method of leadership based on the principle of "from &#13;
			the masses, to the masses", and must cultivate a democratic style &#13;
			and be good at listening to the masses. They must not be despotic &#13;
			like Khrushchov and violate the Party's democratic centralism, make &#13;
			surprise attacks on comrades or act arbitrarily and dictatorially.<br/>&#13;
			They must be modest and prudent and guard against arrogance and &#13;
			impetuosity; they must be imbued with the spirit of selfcriticism &#13;
			and have the courage to correct mistakes and shortcomings in their &#13;
			work. They must never cover up their errors like Khrushchov, and &#13;
			claim all the credit for themselves and shift all the blame on &#13;
			others.<br/>&#13;
			Successors to the revolutionary cause of the proletariat come &#13;
			forward in mass struggles and are tempered in the great storms of &#13;
			revolution. It is essential to test and judge cadres and choose and &#13;
			train successors in the long course of mass struggle.<br/>&#13;

			我们党的组织要向全国发展，要自觉地造就成万数的干部，要有几百个最好的群众领袖。这些干部和领袖懂得马克思列宁主义，有政治远见，有工作能力，富于牺牲精神，能独立解决问题，在困难中不动摇，忠心耿耿地为民族、为阶级、为党而工作。党依靠着这些人而联系党员和群众，依靠着这些人对于群众的坚强领导而达到打倒敌人之目的。这些人不要自私自利，不要个人英雄主义和风头主义，不要懒惰和消极性，不要自高自大的宗派主义，他们是大公无私的民族的阶级的英雄，这就是共产党员、党的干部、党的领袖应该有的性格和作风。<br/>&#13;
			――《为争取千百万群众进入抗日民族统一战线而斗争》（一九三七年五月七日），《毛泽东选集》第一卷第二六七――二六八页<br/>&#13;
			Our Party organizations must be extended all over the country and we &#13;
			must purposefully train tens of thousands of cadres and hundreds of &#13;
			first-rate mass leaders. They must be cadres and leaders versed in &#13;
			Marxism-Leninism, politically far-sighted, competent in work, full &#13;
			of the spirit of selfsacrifice, capable of tackling problems on &#13;
			their own, steadfast in the midst of difficulties and loyal and &#13;
			devoted in serving the nation, the class and the Party. It is on &#13;
			these cadres and leaders that the Party relies for its links with &#13;
			the membership and the masses, and it is by relying on their firm &#13;
			leadership of the masses that the Party can succeed in defeating the &#13;
			enemy. Such cadres and leaders must be free from selfishness, from &#13;
			individualistic heroism, ostentation, sloth, passivity, and arrogant &#13;
			sectarianism, and they must be selfless national and class heroes; &#13;
			such are the qualities and the style of work demanded of the &#13;
			members, cadres and leaders of our Party.<br/>&#13;

			政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。因此，有计划地培养大批的新干部。就是我们的战斗任务。<br/>&#13;

			共产党的干部政策，应是以能否坚决地执行党的路线，服从党的纪律，和群众有密切的联系，有独立的工作能力，积极肯干，不谋私利为标准，这就是“任人唯贤”的路线。<br/>&#13;
			――《中国共产党在民族战争中的地位》（一九三八年十月），《毛泽东选集》第二卷第五一五页<br/>&#13;
			The criterion the Communist Party should apply in its cadres policy &#13;
			is whether or not a cadre is resolute in carrying out the Party &#13;
			line, keeps to Party discipline, has close ties with the masses, has &#13;
			the ability to find his bearings independently, and is active, &#13;
			hardworking and unselfish. This is what "appointing people on their &#13;
			merit" means.<br/>&#13;

			必须坚持干部参加集体生产劳动的制度。我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷。干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义。 &#13;
			<br/>&#13;
			――转摘自《关于赫鲁晓夫的假共产主义及其在世界历史上的教训》，一九六四年七月十四日《人民日报》<br/>&#13;
			It is necessary to maintain the system of cadre participation in &#13;
			collective productive labour. The cadres of our Party and state are &#13;
			ordinary workers and not overlords sitting on the backs of the &#13;
			people. By taking part in collective productive labour, the cadres &#13;
			maintain extensive, constant and close ties with the working people. &#13;
			This is a major measure of fundamental importance for a socialist &#13;
			system; it helps to overcome bureaucracy and to prevent revisionism &#13;
			and dogmatism.<br/>&#13;

			必须善于识别干部。不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作，这是识别干部的主要方法。<br/>&#13;
			――《中国共产党在民族战争中的地位》（一九三八年十月），《毛泽东选集》第二卷第五一五页<br/>&#13;
			We must know how to judge cadres. We must not confine our judgement &#13;
			to a short period or a single incident in a cadre's life, but should &#13;
			consider his life and work as a whole. This is the principal method &#13;
			of judging cadres.<br/>&#13;
			D "The Role of the Chinese Communist Party in the National War" &#13;
			(October 1938), Selected Works, Vol. II, p. 202.<br/>&#13;
			<br/>&#13;
			必须善于使用干部。领导者的责任，归结起来，主要地是出主意、用干部两件事。一切计划、决议、命令、指示等等，都属于“出主意”一类。使这一切主意见之实行，必须团结干部，推动他们去做，属于“用干部”一类。<br/>&#13;
			――《中国共产党在民族战争中的地位》（一九三八年十月），《毛泽东选集》第二卷第五一五页<br/>&#13;
			We must, know how to use cadres well. In the final analysis, &#13;
			leadership involves two main responsibilities: to work out ideas, &#13;
			and to use cadres well. Such things as drawing up plans, making &#13;
			decisions, and giving orders and directives, are all in the category &#13;
			of "working out ideas". To put the ideas into practice, we must weld &#13;
			the cadres together and encourage them to go into action; this comes &#13;
			into the category of "using the cadres well".<br/>&#13;
			D Ibid.<br/>&#13;
			<br/>&#13;
			必须善于爱护干部。爱护的办法是：第一，指导他们。这就是让他们放手工作，使他们敢于负责；同时，又适时地给以指示，使他们能在党的政治路线下发挥其创造性。第二，提高他们。这就是给以学习的机会，教育他们，使他们在理论上在工作能力上提高一步。第三，检查他们的工作，帮助他们总结经验，发扬成绩，纠正错误。有委托而无检查，及至犯了严重的错误，方才加以注意，不是爱护干部的办法。第四，对于犯错误的干部，一般地应采取说服的方法。帮助他们改正错误。只有对犯了严重错误而又不接受指导的人们，才应当采取斗争的方法。在这里，耐心是必要的；轻易地给人们戴上“机会主义”的大帽子，轻易地采用“开展斗争”的方法，是不对的。第五，照顾他们的困难。干部有疾病、生活、家庭等项困难问题者，必须在可能限度内用心给以照顾。这些就是爱护干部的方法。<br/>&#13;
			――《中国共产党在民族战争中的地位》（一九三八年十月），《毛泽东选集》第二卷第五一五――五一六页<br/>&#13;
			We must know how to take good care of cadres. There are several ways &#13;
			of doing so.<br/>&#13;
			First, give them guidance. This means allowing them a free hand in &#13;
			their work so that they have the courage to assume responsibility &#13;
			and, at the same time, giving them timely instructions so that, &#13;
			guided by the Party's political line, they are able to make full use &#13;
			of their initiative.<br/>&#13;
			Second, raise their level. This means educating them by giving them &#13;
			the opportunity to study so that they can enhance their theoretical &#13;
			understanding and their working ability.<br/>&#13;
			Third, check up on their work, and help them sum up their &#13;
			experience, carry forward their achievements and correct their &#13;
			mistakes. To assign work without checking up and to take notice only &#13;
			when serious mistakes are made - that is not the way to take care of &#13;
			cadres.<br/>&#13;
			Fourth, in general, use the method of persuasion with cadres who &#13;
			have made mistakes, and help them correct their mistakes. The method &#13;
			of struggle should be confined to those who make serious mistakes &#13;
			and nevertheless refuse to accept guidance. Here patience is &#13;
			essential. It is wrong lightly to label people "opportunists" or &#13;
			lightly to begin "waging struggles" against them.<br/>&#13;
			Fifth, help them with their difficulties. When cadres are in &#13;
			difficulty as a result of illness, straitened means or domestic or &#13;
			other troubles, we must be sure to give them as much care as &#13;
			possible.<br/>&#13;
			This is how to take good care of cadres.<br/>&#13;
			D Ibid., p. 203.<br/>&#13;
			<br/>&#13;
			凡属真正团结一致、联系群众的领导骨干，必须是从群众斗争中逐渐形成，而不是脱离群众斗争所能形成的。在多数情形下，一个伟大的斗争过程，其开始阶段、中间阶段和最后阶段的领导骨干，不应该是也不可能是完全同一的；必须不断地提拔在斗争中产生的积极分子，来替换原有骨干中相形见绌的分子，或腐化了的分子。<br/>&#13;
			――《关于领导方法的若干问题》（一九四三年六月一日），《毛泽东选集》第三卷第九零零页<br/>&#13;
			A leading group that is genuinely united and is linked with the &#13;
			masses can gradually be formed only in the process of mass struggle, &#13;
			and not in isolation from it. In the process of a great struggle, &#13;
			the composition of the leading group in most cases should not and &#13;
			cannot remain entirely unchanged throughout the initial, middle and &#13;
			final stages; the activists who come forward in the course of the &#13;
			struggle must constantly be promoted to replace those original &#13;
			members of the leading group who are inferior by comparison or who &#13;
			have degenerated.<br/>&#13;
			D "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership" (June 1, 1943), &#13;
			Selected Works, Vol. III, p. 118.*<br/>&#13;
			<br/>&#13;
			我们党如果没有广大的新干部同老干部一致合作，我们的事业就会中断。所以一切老干部应该以极大的热忱欢迎新干部，关心新干部。不错，新干部是有缺点的，他们参加革命还不久，还缺乏经验，他们中的有些人还不免带来旧社会不良思想的尾巴，这就是小资产阶级个人主义思想的残余。但是这些缺点是可以从教育中从革命锻炼中逐渐地去掉的。他们的长处，正如斯大林说过的，是对于新鲜事物有锐敏的感觉，因而有高度的热情和积极性，而在这一点上，有些老干部则正是缺乏的。新老干部应该是彼此尊重，互相学习，取长补短，以便团结一致，进行共同的事业，而防止宗派主义的倾向。<br/>&#13;
			――《整顿党的作风》（一九四二年二月一日），《毛泽东选集》第三卷第八二六页<br/>&#13;
			If our Party does not have a great many new cadres working in unity &#13;
			and cooperation with the old cadres, our cause will come to a stop. &#13;
			All old cadres, therefore, should welcome the new ones with the &#13;
			utmost enthusiasm and show them the warmest solicitude. True, new &#13;
			cadres have their shortcomings. They have not been long in the &#13;
			revolution and lack experience, and unavoidably some have brought &#13;
			with them vestiges of the unwholesome ideology of the old society, &#13;
			remnants of the ideology of petty-bourgeois individualism. But such &#13;
			shortcomings can be gradually eliminated through education and &#13;
			tempering in the revolution. The strong point of the new cadres, as &#13;
			Stalin has said, is that they are acutely sensitive to what is new &#13;
			and are therefore enthusiastic and active to a high degree - the &#13;
			very qualities which some of the old cadres lack. Cadres, new and &#13;
			old, should respect each other, learn from each other and overcome &#13;
			their own shortcomings by learning from each other's strong points, &#13;
			so as to unite as one in the common cause and guard against &#13;
			sectarian tendencies.<br/>&#13;
			D "Rectify the Party's Style of Work" (February 1, 1942), Selected &#13;
			Works, Vol. III, p. 47.<br/>&#13;
			<br/>&#13;
			不但要关心党的干部，还要关心非党的干部。党外存在着很多的人材，共产党不能把他们置之度外。去掉孤傲习气，善于和非党干部共事，真心诚意地帮助他们，用热烈的同志的态度对待他们，把他们的积极性组织到抗日和建国的伟大事业中去，这是每一个共产党员的责任。<br/>&#13;
			――《中国共产党在民族战争中的地位》（一九三八年十月），《毛泽东选集》第二卷第五一五页<br/>&#13;
			Our concern should extend to non-Party cadres as well as to Party &#13;
			cadres. There are many capable people outside the Party whom we must &#13;
			not ignore. The duty of every Communist is to rid himself of &#13;
			aloofness and arrogance and to work well with non-Party cadres, give &#13;
			them sincere help, have a warm, comradely attitude towards them and &#13;
			enlist their initiative in the great cause of resisting Japan and &#13;
			reconstructing the nation.<br/>&#13;
