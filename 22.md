			人类的历史，就是一个不断地从必然王国向自由王国发展的历史。这个历史永远不会完结。在有阶级存在的社会内，阶级斗争不会完结。在无阶级存在的社会内，新与旧、正确与错误之间的斗争永远不会完结。在生产斗争和科学实验范围内，人类总是不断发展的，自然界也总是不断发展的，永远不会停止在一个水平上。因此，人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。停止的论点，悲观的论点，无所作为和骄傲自满的论点都是错误的。其所以是错误，因为这些论点，不符合大约一百万年以来人类社会发展的历史事实，也不符合迄今为止我们所知道的自然界（例如天体史，地球史，生物史，其他各种自然科学史所反映的自然界）的历史事实。<br/>&#13;

			人们在社会实践中从事各项斗争，有了丰富的经验，有成功的，有失败的。无数客观外界的现象通过人的眼、耳、鼻、舌、身这五个官能反映到自己的头脑中来，开始是感性认识。这种感性认识的材料积累多了，就会产生一个飞跃，变成了理性认识，这就是思想。这是一个认识过程。这是整个认识过程的第一个阶段，即由客观物质到主观精神的阶段，由存在到思想的阶段。这时候的精神、思想（包括理论、政策、计划、办法）是否正确地反映了客观外界的规律，还是没有证明的，还不能确定是否正确，然后又有认识过程的第二个阶段，即由精神到物质的阶段，由思想到存在的阶段，这就是把第一个阶段得到的认识放到社会实践中去，看这些理论、政策、计划、办法等等是否能得到预期的成功。一般的说来，成功了的就是正确的，失败了的就是错误的，特别是人类对自然界的斗争是如此。在社会斗争中，代表先进阶级的势力，有时候有些失败，并不是因为思想不正确，而是因为在斗争力量的对比上，先进势力这一方，暂时还不如反动势力那一方，所以暂时失败了，但是以后总有一天会要成功的。人们的认识经过实践的考验，又会产生一个飞跃。这次飞跃，比起前一次飞跃来，意义更加伟大。因为只有这一次飞跃才能证明认识的第一次飞跃，即从客观外界的反映过程中得到的思想、理论、计划、办法等等，究竟是正确的还是错误的，此外再无别的检验真理的办法。<br/>&#13;

			In their social practice, men engage in various kinds of struggle &#13;
			and gain rich experience, both from their successes and from their &#13;
			failures. Countless phenomena of the objective external world are &#13;
			reflected in a man's brain through his five sense organs - the &#13;
			organs of sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch. At first, &#13;
			knowledge is perceptual. The leap to conceptual knowledge, i e., to &#13;
			ideas, occurs when sufficient perceptual knowledge is accumulated. &#13;
			This is one process in cognition. It is the first stage in the whole &#13;
			process of cognition, the stage leading from objective matter to &#13;
			subjective consciousness, from existence to ideas. Whether or not &#13;
			one's consciousness or ideas (including theories, policies, plans or &#13;
			measures) do correctly reflect the laws of the objective external &#13;
			world is not yet proved at this stage, in which it is not yet &#13;
			possible to ascertain whether they are correct or not. Then comes &#13;
			the second stage in the process of cognition, the stage leading from &#13;
			consciousness back to matter, from ideas back to existence, in which &#13;
			the knowledge gained in the first stage is applied in social practice &#13;
			to ascertain whether the theories, policies, plans or measures meet &#13;
			with the anticipated success. Generally speaking, those that succeed &#13;
			are correct and those that fail are incorrect, and this is &#13;
			especially true of man's struggle with nature. In social struggle, &#13;
			the forces representing the advanced class sometimes suffer defeat &#13;
			not because their ideas are incorrect but because, in the balance of &#13;
			forces engaged in struggle, they are not as powerful for the time &#13;
			being as the forces of reaction; they are therefore temporarily &#13;
			defeated, but they are bound to triumph sooner or later. Man's &#13;
			knowledge makes another leap through the test of practice. This leap &#13;
			is more important than the previous one. For it is this leap alone &#13;
			that can prove the correctness or incorrectness of the first leap in &#13;
			cognition, i.e., of the ideas, theories, policies, plans or measures &#13;
			formulated in the course of reflecting the objective external world. &#13;
			There is no other way of testing truth.<br/>&#13;

			研究问题，忌带主观性、片面性和表面性。所谓主观性，就是不知道客观地看问题，也就是不知道用唯物的观点去看问题。这一点，我在《实践论》一文中已经说过了。所谓片面性，就是不知道全面地看问题。……或者叫做只看见局部，不看见全体，只看见树木，不看见森林。这样，是不能找出解决矛盾的方法的，是不能完成革命任务的，是不能做好所任工作的，是不能正确地发展党内的思想斗争的。孙子论军事说：“知彼知己，百战不殆。”他说的是作战的双方。唐朝人魏征说过：“兼听则明，偏信则暗。”也懂得片面性不对。可是我们的同志看问题，往往带片面性，这样的人就往往碰钉子。……列宁说：“要真正地认识对象，就必须把握和研究它的一切方面、一切联系和‘媒介’。我们决不会完全地作到这一点，可是要求全面性，将使我们防止错误，防止僵化。”我们应该记得他的话。表面性，是对矛盾总体和矛盾各方的特点都不去看，否认深入事物里面精细地研究矛盾特点的必要，仅仅站在那里远远地望一望，粗枝大叶地看到一点矛盾的形相，就想动手去解决矛盾（答复问题、解决纠纷、处理工作、指挥战争）。这样的做法，没有不出乱子的。……片面性、表面性也是主观性，因为一切客观事物本来是互相联系的和具有内部规律的，人们不去如实地反映这些情况，而只是片面地或表面地去看它们，不认识事物的互相联系，不认识事物的内部规律，所以这种方法是主观主义的。<br/>&#13;

			trees but not the forest. That way it is impossible to find the &#13;
			method for resolving a contradiction, it is impossible to accomplish &#13;
			the tasks of the revolution, to carry out assignments well or to &#13;
			develop inner-Party ideological struggle correctly. When Sun Wu Tzu &#13;
			said in discussing military science, "Know the enemy and know &#13;
			yourself, and you can fight a hundred battles with no danger of &#13;
			defeat", he was referring to the two sides in a battle. Wei Cheng of &#13;
			the Tang Dynasty also understood the error of one-sidedness when he &#13;
			said, "Listen to both sides and you will be enlightened, heed only &#13;
			one side and you will be benighted." But our comrades often look at &#13;
			problems one-sidedly, and so they often run into snags. ... Lenin &#13;
			said: "... in order really to know an object we must embrace, study, &#13;
			all its sides, all connections and "mediations". We shall never &#13;
			achieve this completely, but the demand for all-sidedness is a &#13;
			safeguard against mistakes and rigidity." We should remember his &#13;
			words. To be superficial means to consider neither the &#13;
			characteristics of a contradiction in its totality nor the &#13;
			characteristics of each of its aspects; it means to deny the &#13;
			necessity for probing deeply into a thing and minutely studying the &#13;
			characteristics of its contradiction, but instead merely to look &#13;
			from afar and, after glimpsing the rough outline, immediately to try &#13;
			to resolve the contradiction (to answer a question, settle a &#13;
			dispute, handle work, or direct a military operation). This way of &#13;
			doing things is bound to lead to trouble. ...To be one-sided and &#13;
			superficial is at the same time to be subjective. For all objective &#13;
			things are actually interconnected and are governed by inner laws, &#13;
			but, instead of undertaking the task of reflecting things as they &#13;
			really are, some people only look at things one-sidedly or &#13;
			superficially and know neither their interconnections nor their &#13;
			inner laws, and so their method is subjectivist.<br/>&#13;

			片面性就是思想上的绝对化，就是形而上学地看问题。对于我们的工作的看法，肯定一切或者否定一切，都是片面性的。……肯定一切，就是只看到好的，看不到坏的，只能赞扬，不能批评。说我们的工作似乎一切都好，这不合乎事实。不是一切都好，还有缺点和错误。但是也不是一切都坏，这也不合乎事实。要加以分析。否定一切，就是不加分析地认为事情都做得不好，社会主义建设这样一个伟大事业，几亿人口所进行的这个伟大斗争，似乎没有什么好处可说，一团糟。许多具有这种看法的人，虽然和那些对社会主义制度心怀敌意的人还不相同，但是这种看法是很错误的，很有害的，它只会使人丧失信心。不论是用肯定一切的观点或者否定一切的观点来看我们的工作，都是错误的。<br/>&#13;

			good and not the bad, and to tolerate only praise and no criticism. &#13;
			To talk as though our work is good in every respect is at variance &#13;

			everything is bad, and that, too, is at variance with the facts. &#13;
			Here analysis is necessary. To negate everything is to think, &#13;
			without having made any analysis, that nothing has been done well &#13;
			and that the great work of socialist construction, the great &#13;
			struggle in which hundreds of millions of people are participating, &#13;
