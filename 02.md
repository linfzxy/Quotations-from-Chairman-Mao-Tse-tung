			谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。中国过去一切革命斗争成效甚少，其基本原因就是因为不能团结真正的朋友，以攻击真正的敌人。革命党是群众的向导，在革命中未有革命党领错了路而革命不失败的。我们的革命要有不领错路和一定成功的把握，不可不注意团结我们的真正的朋友，以攻击我们的真正的敌人。我们要分辨真正的敌友，不可不将中国社会各阶级的经济地位及其对于革命的态度，作一个大概的分析。 &#13;

			――《中国社会各阶级的分析》（一九二六年三月），《毛泽东选集》第一卷第三页 <br/>&#13;
			Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is a question of the &#13;
			first importance for the revolution. The basic reason why all &#13;
			previous revolutionary struggles in China achieved so little was &#13;
			their failure to unite with real friends in order to attack real &#13;
			enemies. A revolutionary party is the guide of the masses, and no &#13;
			revolution ever succeeds when the revolutionary party leads them &#13;
			astray. To ensure that we will definitely achieve success in our &#13;
			revolution and will not lead the masses astray, we must pay &#13;
			attention to uniting with our real friends in order to attack our &#13;
			real enemies. To distinguish real friends from real enemies, we must &#13;
			make a general analysis of the economic status of the various &#13;
			classes in Chinese society and of their respective attitudes towards &#13;
			the revolution.<br/>&#13;

			一切勾结帝国主义的军阀、官僚、买办阶级、大地主阶级以及附属于他们的一部分反动知识界，是我们的敌人。工业无产阶级是我们革命的领导力量。一切半无产阶级、小资产阶级，是我们最接近的朋友。那动摇不定的中产阶级，其右翼可能是我们的敌人，其左翼可能是我们的朋友――但我们要时常提防他们，不要让他们扰乱了我们的阵线。 &#13;

			我认为，对我们来说，一个人，一个党，一个军队，或者一个学校，如若不被敌人反对，那就不好了那一定是同敌人同流合污了。如若被敌人反对，那就好了，那就证明我们同敌人划清界线了。如若敌人起劲地反对我们，把我们说得一塌糊涂，一无是处，那就更好了，那就证明我们不但同敌人划清了界线，而且证明我们的工作是很有成绩的了。 &#13;

			在我国，资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想，反马克思主义的思想，还会长期存在。社会主义制度在我国已经基本建立。我们已经在生产资料所有制的改造方面，取得了基本胜利，但是在政治战线和思想战线方面，我们还没有完全取得胜利。无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的谁胜谁负问题，还没有真正解决。我们同资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想还要进行长期的斗争。不了解这种情况，放弃思想斗争，那就是错误的。凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。但是，这种批判，应该是充分说理的，有分析的，有说服力的，而不应该是粗暴的、官僚主义的，或者是形而上学的、教条主义的。 &#13;

			教条主义和修正主义都是违反马克思主义的。马克思主义一定要向前发展，要随着实践的发展而发展，不能停滞不前。停止了，老是那么一套，它就没有生命了。但是，马克思主义的基本原则又是不能违背的，违背了就要犯错误。用形而上学的观点来看待马克思主义，把它看成僵死的东西，这是教条主义。否定马克思主义的基本原则，否定马克思主义的普遍真理，这就是修正主义。修正主义是一种资产阶级思想。修正主义者抹杀社会主义和资本主义的区别，抹杀无产阶级专政和资产阶级专政的区别。他们所主张的，在实际上并不是社会主义路线，而是资本主义路线。在现在的情况下，修正主义的比教条主义更有害的东西。我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。 &#13;
			<br/>&#13;
			――《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》（一九五七年三月十二日），人民出版社版第二零――二十一页 <br/>&#13;
			Both dogmatism and revisionism run counter to Marxism. Marxism must &#13;
			certainly advance; it must develop along with the development of &#13;
			practice and cannot stand still. It would become lifeless if it &#13;
			remained stagnant and stereotyped. However, the basic principles of &#13;
			Marxism must never be violated, or otherwise mistakes will be made. &#13;
			It is dogmatism to approach Marxism from a metaphysical point of &#13;
			view and to regard it as something rigid. It is revisionism to &#13;
			negate the basic principles of Marxism and to negate its universal &#13;
			truth. Revisionism is one form of bourgeois ideology. The &#13;
			revisionists deny the differences between socialism and capitalism, &#13;
			between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of &#13;
			the bourgeoisie. What they advocate is in fact not the socialist &#13;
			line but the capitalist line. In present circumstances, revisionism &#13;
			is more pernicious than dogmatism. One of our current important &#13;
			tasks on the ideological front is to unfold criticism of &#13;

			修正主义，或者右倾机会主义，是一种资产阶级思潮，它比教条主义有更大的危险性。修正主义者，右倾机会主义者，口头上也挂着马克思主义，他们也在那里攻击“教条主义”。但是他们所攻击的正是马克思主义的最根本的东西。他们反对或者歪曲唯物论和辩证法，反对或者企图削弱人民民主专政和共产党的领导，反对或者企图削弱社会主义改造和社会主义建设。在我国社会主义革命取得基本胜利以后，社会上还有一部分人梦想恢复资本主义制度，他们要从各个方面向工人阶级进行斗争，包括思想方面的斗争。而在这个斗争中，修正主义者就是他们最好的助手。 &#13;

			――《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》（一九五七年二月二十七日），人民出版社版第二九――三零页 <br/>&#13;
			Revisionism, or Right opportunism, is a bourgeois trend of thought &#13;
			that is even more dangerous than dogmatism. The revisionists, the &#13;
			Right opportunists, pay lipservice to Marxism; they too attack &#13;
			"dogmatism". But what they are really attacking is the quintessence &#13;
			of Marxism. They oppose or distort materialism and dialectics, &#13;
			oppose or try to weaken the people's democratic dictatorship and the &#13;
			leading role of the Communist Party, and oppose or try to weaken &#13;

			a number of people who vainly hope to restore the capitalist system &#13;
			and fight the working class on every front, including the &#13;
