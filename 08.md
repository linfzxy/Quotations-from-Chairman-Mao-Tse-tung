			真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。这是真正的铜墙铁壁，什么力量也打不破的，完全打不破的。反革命打不破我们，我们却要打破反革命。在革命政府的周围团结起千百万群众来，发展我们的革命战争，我们就能消灭一切反革命，我们就能夺取全中国。<br/>&#13;

			战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中。日本敢于欺负我们，主要的原因在于中国民众的无组织状态。克服了这一缺点，就把日本侵略者置于我们数万万站起来了的人民之前，使它象一匹野牛冲入火阵，我们一声唤也要把它吓一大跳，这匹野牛就非烧死不可。<br/>&#13;

			The richest source of power to wage war lies in the masses of the &#13;

			人民的游击战争，从整个革命战争的观点看来，和主力红军是互为左右手，只有主力红军而无人民的游击战争，就象一个独臂将军。根据地的人民条件，具体地说来，特别是对于作战说来，就是有武装起来了的人民。敌人视为畏途，主要地也在这一点。<br/>&#13;

			Considering the revolutionary war as a whole, the operations of the &#13;
			people's guerrillas and those of the main forces of the Red Army &#13;
			complement each other like a man's right arm and left arm, and if we &#13;
			had only the main forces of the Red Army without the people's &#13;
			guerrillas, we would be like a warrior with only one arm. In &#13;
			concrete terms, and especially with regard to military operations, &#13;
			when we talk of the people in the base area as a factor, we mean &#13;
			that we have an armed people. That is the main reason why the enemy &#13;
			is afraid to approach our base area.<br/>&#13;

			<br/>&#13;
			战争胜负，主要地决定于作战双方的军事、政治、经济、自然诸条件，这是没有问题的。然而不仅仅如此，还决定于作战双方主观指导的能力。军事家不能超过物质条件许可的范围外企图战争的胜利，然而军事家可以而且必须在物质条件许可的范围内争取战争的胜利。军事家活动的舞台建筑在客观物质条件的上面，然而军事家凭着这个舞台，却可以导演出许多有声有色威武雄壮的活剧来。<br/>&#13;
			――《中国革命战争的战略问题》（一九三六年十二月），《毛泽东选集》第一卷第一七五页<br/>&#13;
			Unquestionably, victory or defeat in war is determined mainly by the &#13;
			military, political, economic and natural conditions on both sides. &#13;
			But not by these alone. It is also determined by each side's &#13;
			subjective ability in directing the war. In his endeavour to win a &#13;
			war, a military strategist cannot overstep the limitations imposed &#13;
			by the material conditions; within these limitations, however, he &#13;
			can and must strive for victory. The stage of action for a military &#13;
			strategist is built upon objective material conditions, but on that &#13;
			stage he can direct the performance of many a drama, full of sound &#13;
			and colour, power and grandeur.<br/>&#13;
			D Ibid., pp. 190-91.*<br/>&#13;
			<br/>&#13;
			战争的目的不是别的，就是“保存自己，消灭敌人”（消灭敌人，就是解除敌人的武装，也就是所谓“剥夺敌人的抵抗力”，不是要完全消灭其肉体）。古代战争，用矛用盾：矛是进攻的，为了消灭敌人；盾是防御的，为了保存自己。直到今天的武器，还是这二者的继续。轰炸机、机关枪、远射程炮、毒气，是矛的发展；防空掩蔽部、钢盔、水泥工事、防毒面具，是盾的发展。坦克，是矛盾二者结合为一的新式武器。进攻，是消灭敌人的主要手段，但防御也是不能废的。进攻，是直接为了消灭敌人的，同时也是为了保存自己，因为如不消灭敌人，则自己将被消灭。防御，是直接为了保存自己的，但同时也是辅助进攻或准备转入进攻的一种手段。退却，属于防御一类，是防御的继续；而追击，则是进攻的继续。应该指出：战争目的中，消灭敌人是主要的，保存自己是第二位的，因为只有大量地消灭敌人，才能有效地保存自己。因此，作为消灭敌人之主要手段的进攻是主要的，而作为消灭敌人之辅助手段和作为保存自己之一种手段的防御，是第二位的。战争实际中，虽有许多时候以防御为主，而在其余时候以进攻为主，然而通战争的全体来看，进攻仍然是主要的。<br/>&#13;
			――《论持久战》（一九三八年五月），《毛泽东选集》第二卷第四七一――四七二页<br/>&#13;
			The object of war is specifically "to preserve oneself and destroy &#13;
			the enemy" (to destroy the enemy means to disarm him or "deprive him &#13;
			of the power to resist", and does not mean to destroy every member &#13;
			of his forces physically). In ancient warfare, the spear and the &#13;
			shield were used, the spear to attack and destroy the enemy, and the &#13;
			shield to defend and preserve oneself. To the present day, all &#13;
			weapons are still an extension of the spear and the shield. The &#13;
			bomber, the machine-gun, the longrange gun and poison gas are &#13;
			developments of the spear, while the air-raid shelter, the steel &#13;
			helmet, the concrete fortification and the gas mask are &#13;
			developrnents of the shield. The tank is a new weapon combining the &#13;
			functions of both spear and shield. Attack is the chief means of &#13;
			destroying the enemy, but defence cannot be dispensed with. In &#13;
			attack the immediate object is to destroy the enemy, but at the same &#13;
			time it is self-preservation, because if the enemy is not destroyed, &#13;
			you will be destroyed. In defence the immediate object is to &#13;
			preserve yourself, but at the same time defence is a means of &#13;
			supplementing attack or preparing to go over to the attack. Retreat &#13;
			is in the category of defence and is a continuation of defence, &#13;
			while pursuit is a continuation of attack. It should be pointed out &#13;
			that destruction of the enemy is the primary object of war and &#13;
			self-preservation the secondary, because only by destroying the &#13;
			enemy in large numbers can one effectively preserve oneself. &#13;
			Therefore attack, the chief means of destroying the enemy, is &#13;
			primary, while defence, a supplementary means of destroying the &#13;
			enemy and a means of self-preservation, is secondary. In actual &#13;
			warfare the chief role is played by defence much of the time and by &#13;
			attack for the rest of the time, but if war is taken as a whole, &#13;
			attack remains primary.<br/>&#13;
			D "On Protracted War" (May 1938). Selected Works, Vol. II, p. 156.<br/>&#13;
			<br/>&#13;
			一切军事行动的指导原则，都根据于一个基本的原则，就是：尽可能地保存自己的力量，消灭敌人的力量。……何以解释战争中提倡勇敢牺牲呢？每一战争都须支付代价，有时是极大的代价，岂非和“保存自己”相矛盾？其实一点也不矛盾，正确点说，是相反相成的。因为这种牺牲，不但是为了消灭敌人的必要，也是为了保存自己的必要――部分的暂的“不保存”（牺牲或支付），是为了全体的永久的保存所必需的。在这个基本的原则上，发生了指导整个军事行动的一系列的所谓原则，从射击原则（荫蔽身体，发扬火力，前者为了保存自己，后者为了消灭敌人）起，到战略原则止，都贯彻这个基本原则的精神。一切技术的、战术的、战役的、战略的原则，都是执行这个基本原则时的条件。保存自己消灭敌人的原则，是一切军事原则的根据。<br/>&#13;
			――《抗日游击战争的战略问题》（一九三八年五月），《毛泽东选集》第二卷第三九七――三九八页<br/>&#13;
			All the guiding principles of military operations grow out of the &#13;
			one basic principle: to strive to the utmost to preserve one's own &#13;
			strength and destroy that of the enemy.... How then do we justify &#13;
			the encouragement of heroic sacrifice in war? Every war exacts a &#13;
			price, sometimes an extremely high one. Is this not in contradiction &#13;
			with "preserving oneself"? In fact, there is no contradiction at &#13;
			all; to put it more exactly, sacrifice and self-preservation are &#13;
			both opposite and complementary to each other. For such sacrifice is &#13;
			essential not only for destroying the enemy but also for preserving &#13;
			oneself - partial and temporary "non-preservation" (sacrifice, or &#13;
			paying the price) is necessary for the sake of general and permanent &#13;
			preservation. From this basic principle stems the series of &#13;
			principles guiding military operations, all of which - from the &#13;
			principles of shooting (taking cover to preserve oneself, and making &#13;
			full use of fire-power to destroy the enemy) to the principles of &#13;
			strategy - are permeated with the spirit of this basic principle. &#13;
			All technical principles and all principles concerning tactics, &#13;
			campaigns and strategy represent applications of this basic &#13;
			principle. The principle of preserving oneself and destroying the &#13;
			enemy is the basis of all military principles.<br/>&#13;

			我们的军事原则是：（1）先打分散和孤立之敌，后打集中和强大之敌。（2）先取小城市、中等城市和广大乡村，后取大城市。（3）以歼灭敌人有生力量为主要目标，不以保守或夺取城市和地方为主要目标。保守或夺取城市和地方，是歼灭敌人有生力量的结果，往往需要反复多次才能最后地保守或夺取之。（4）每战集中绝对优势兵力（两倍、三倍、四倍、有时甚至是五倍或六倍于敌之兵力），四面包围敌人，力求全歼，不使漏网。在特殊情况下则采用给敌以歼灭性打击的方法，即集中全力打敌正面及其一翼或两翼，求达歼灭其一部、击溃其另一部的目的，以便我军能够迅速转移兵力歼击他部敌军。力求避免打那种得不偿失的、或得失相当的消耗战。这样，在全体上，我们是劣势（就数量来说），但在每一个局部上，在每一个具体战役上，我们是绝对的优势，这就保证了战役的胜利。随着时间的推移，我们就将在全体上转变为优势，直到歼灭一切敌人。（5）不打无准备之仗，不打无把握之仗，每战都应力求有准备，力求在敌我条件对比下有胜利的把握。（6）发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。（7）力求在运动中歼灭敌人。同时，注重阵地攻击战术，夺取敌人的据点和城市。（8）在攻城问题上，一切敌人守备薄弱的据点和城市，坚决夺取之。一切敌人有中等程度的守备、而环境又许可加以夺取的据点和城市，相机夺取之。一切敌人守备强固的据点和城市，则等候条件成熟时然后夺取之。（9）以俘获敌人的全部武器和大部人员，补充自己。我军人力物力的来源，主要在前线。（10）善于利用两个战役之间的间隙，休息和整训部队。休整的时间，一般地不要过长，尽可能不使敌人获得喘息的时间。以上这些，就是人民解放军打败蒋介石的主要的方法。这些方法，是人民解放军在和国内外敌人长期作战的锻炼中产生出来，并完全适合我们目前的情况的。……我们的战略战术是建立在人民战争这个基础上的，任何反人民的军队都不能利用我们的战略战术。<br/>&#13;
			――《目前形势和我们的任务》（一九四七年十二月二十五日），《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一二四七――一二四八页<br/>&#13;
			Our principles of operation are:<br/>&#13;
			(1) Attack dispersed, isolated enemy forces first; attack &#13;
			concentrated, strong enemy forces later.<br/>&#13;
			(2) Take small and medium cities and extensive rural areas first; &#13;
			take big cities later.<br/>&#13;
			(3) Make wiping out the enemy's effective strength our main &#13;
			objective; do not make holding or seizing a city or place our main &#13;
			objective. Holding or seizing a city or place is the outcome of &#13;
			wiping out the enemy's effective strength, and often a city or place &#13;
			can be held or seized for good only after it has changed hands a &#13;
			number of times.<br/>&#13;
			(4) In every battle, concentrate an absolutely superior force (two, &#13;
			three, four and sometimes even five or six times the enemy's &#13;
			strength), encircle the enemy forces completely, strive to wipe them &#13;
			out thoroughly and do not let any escape from the net. In special &#13;
			circumstances, use the method of dealing the enemy crushing blows, &#13;
			that is, concentrate all our strength to make a frontal attack and &#13;
			an attack on one or both of his flanks, with the aim of wiping out &#13;
			one part and routing another so that our army can swiftly move its &#13;
			troops to smash other enemy forces. Strive to avoid battles of &#13;
			attrition in which we lose more than we gain or only break even. In &#13;
			this way, although inferior as a whole (in terms of numbers), we &#13;
			shall be absolutely superior in every part and every specific &#13;
			campaign, and this ensures victory in the campaign. As time goes on, &#13;
			we shall become superior as a whole and eventually wipe out all the &#13;
			enemy.<br/>&#13;
			(5) Fight no battle unprepared, fight no battle you are not sure of &#13;
			winning; make every effort to be well prepared for each battle, make &#13;
			every effort to ensure victory in the given set of conditions as &#13;
			between the enemy and ourselves.<br/>&#13;
			(6) Give full play to our style of fighting - courage in battle, no &#13;
			fear of sacrifice, no fear of fatigue, and continuous fighting (that &#13;
			is, fighting successive battles in a short time without rest).<br/>&#13;
			(7) Strive to wipe out the enemy when he is on the move. At the same &#13;
			time, pay attention to the tactics of positional attack and capture &#13;
			enemy fortified points and cities.<br/>&#13;
			(8) With regard to attacking cities, resolutely seize all enemy &#13;
			fortified points and cities which are weakly defended. At opportune &#13;
			moments, seize all enemy fortified points and cities defended with &#13;
			moderate strength, provided circumstances permit. As for all &#13;
			strongly defended enemy fortified points and cities, wait till &#13;
			conditions are ripe and then take them.<br/>&#13;
			(9) Replenish our strength with all the arms and most of the &#13;
			personnel captured from the enemy. Our army's main sources of &#13;
			manpower and materiel are at the front.<br/>&#13;
			(10) Make good use of the intervals between campaigns to rest, train &#13;
			and consolidate our troops. Periods of rest, training and &#13;
			consolidation should not in general be very long, and the enemy &#13;
			should so far as possible be permitted no breathing space.<br/>&#13;
			These are the main methods the People's Liberation Army has employed &#13;
			in defeating Chiang Kai-shek. They are the result of the tempering &#13;
			of the People's Liberation Army in long years of fighting against &#13;
			domestic and foreign enemies and are completely suited to our &#13;
			present situation. . . . our strategy and tactics are based on a &#13;
			people's war; no army opposed to the people can use our strategy and &#13;
			tactics.<br/>&#13;

			优势而无准备，不是真正的优势，也没有主动。懂得这一点，劣势而有准备之军，常可对敌举行不意的攻势，把优势者打败。<br/>&#13;
			――《论持久战》（一九三八年五月），《毛泽东选集》第二卷第四八一页<br/>&#13;
			Without preparedness superiority is not real superiority and there &#13;
			can be no initiative either. Having grasped this point, a force &#13;
			which is inferior but prepared can often defeat a superior enemy by &#13;
			surprise attack.<br/>&#13;
